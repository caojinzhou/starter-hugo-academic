abstract: The development of information and communication technologies has produced
  massive human sensing data sets, such as point of interest, mobile phone data, and
  social media data sets. These data sets provide alternative human perceptions of
  urban spaces; therefore, they have become effective supplements for remote sensing
  tasks. This letter presents an exploratory framework to examine the scale effect
  of fusing remote sensing and human sensing. The physical and social semantics are
  extracted from raw remote sensing images and human sensing data, respectively. A
  dynamic weighting strategy is developed to explore the fusion of remote sensing
  and human sensing. Taking urban function inference as an example, the scale effect
  is evaluated by weighting remote sensing and human sensing. The experiment demonstrates
  that fusing remote sensing and human sensing enables us to recognize multiple types
  of urban functions. Meanwhile, the results are significantly affected by the scale.
