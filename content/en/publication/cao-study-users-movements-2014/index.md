abstract: With the development of GPS technology and the increasing popularity of
  mobile device, Location-based Social Networks (LBSN) has become a platform that
  promote the understanding of user behavior, which offers unique conditions for the
  study of users' movement patterns. Characteristics of users' movements can be expressed
  by places they've visited. This paper presents a method to analyze characteristics
  of users' movements in spatial and temporal domain based on data collected from
  a Chinese LBSN Sina Weibo. This paper analyzes spatial characteristics of users'
  movement by clustering geographic areas through their check-in popularity. Meanwhile,
  temporal characteristics and variation of users' movements on the timeline is analyzed
  by applying statistical method.
