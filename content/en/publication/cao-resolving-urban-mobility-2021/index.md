abstract: Human movements and interactions with cities are characterized by urban
  mobility networks. Many studies that address urban mobility are inspired by complex
  networks. The models of complex networks require a large amount of empirical data.
  However, current works relied on traditional survey data and were unable to take
  full advantage of the capabilities offered by complex networks; thus, the possibility
  of quantifying urban mobility networks by considering individual travel patterns
  has not yet been addressed. This study presents a data-driven approach for characterizing
  urban mobility networks based on massive-scale mobile phone tracking data. Individual
  travel motifs are first extracted using a graph-based approach. The global urban
  mobility network (G-UMN) and the motif-dependent urban mobility subnetworks (MD-UMNs)
  are then constructed. Next, network properties, including statistical measures and
  scaling relations between the basic measures, are proposed for characterizing mobility
  networks. We have conducted experiments focusing on Shenzhen, China. The results
  demonstrated that (1) the individual travel motifs are structurally and spatially
  heterogeneous, (2) the G-UMN exhibits a evolutionary hierarchical structure, and
  (3) the MD-UMNs show many behavioral differences in their spatial and topological
  properties, reflecting the impacts of the heterogeneity of the individual travel
  motifs. These results bridge the gap between complex network properties and urban
  mobility patterns and provide crucial implications and policies for data-informed
  urban planning.
