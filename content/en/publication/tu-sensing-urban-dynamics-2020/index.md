abstract: City is the place aggregated massive human activities. City is the exchange
  hub of population flow, goods flow, information flow and currency flow, which is
  highly dynamic and complex. Smart city provides various tools to acquire spatiotemporal
  big data, such as satellite and drone remote sensing, mobile sensing, social sensing,
  crowdsourcing sensing, etc., which enable us to sense urban dynamics. This paper
  introduces the framework of urban dynamic sensing, describes the typical applications
  of spatial dynamics, human behavior dynamics and space-behavior interaction dynamics,
  and discusses the problems, such as the uncertainty in spatiotemporal big data,
  the multi-view ensemble learning in urban sensing, the verification of the urban
  dynamic results and the cascading influence of multi-urban factors. Outlooking the
  future, the study of urban dynamics should combine with real-time Internet of things
  data to sense multi-dimensional, multi-spatiotemporal resolution urban dynamic to
  enable refined urban governance and to effectively solve urban problems.
