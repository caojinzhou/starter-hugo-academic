abstract: Passively-generated data, such as GPS data and cellular data, bring tremendous
  opportunities for human mobility analysis and transportation applications. Since
  their primary purposes are often non-transportation related, the passively-generated
  data need to be processed to extract trips. Most existing trip extraction methods
  rely on data that are generated via a single positioning technology such as GPS
  or triangulation through cellular towers (thereby called single-sourced data), and
  methods to extract trips from data generated via multiple positioning technologies
  (or, multisourced data) are absent. And yet, multi-sourced data are now increasingly
  common. Generated using multiple technologies (e.g., GPS, cellular network- and
  WiFi-based), multi-sourced data contain high variances in their temporal and spatial
  properties. In this study, we propose a ``Divide, Conquer and Integrate'' (DCI)
  framework to extract trips from multi-sourced data. We evaluate the proposed framework
  by applying it to an app-based data, which is multisourced and has high variances
  in both location accuracy and observation interval (i.e. time interval between two
  consecutive observations). The effectiveness of the framework is illustrated by
  consistent mobility patterns obtained from the app-based data and an externally
  collected household travel survey data for the same region and the same period.
