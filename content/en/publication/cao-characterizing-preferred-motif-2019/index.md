abstract: People's daily travels are structured and can be expressed as networks.
  Few studies explore how people organize their daily travels and which behavioral
  principles result in the choices of specific network types. In this study, we first
  reconstruct location networks and activity networks for numerous individuals from
  high-resolution mobile phone positioning data and define frequent networks as motifs.
  The results suggest that 99.9% of people's travels can be characterized by a limited
  set of location-based motifs and activity-based motifs. The results further reveal
  that the least effort principle governs the preferred motif choices through quantifying
  the rank-frequency properties. The scaling properties of distance characteristically
  impact motifs, and their scaling differences by node numbers and motif types coincide
  with the popularities of motifs, verifying the self-adaptions in motif choices;
  that is, although individuals travel with unique propensities, they always tend
  to choose the motif with the lowest consumption that satisfies their demand.
