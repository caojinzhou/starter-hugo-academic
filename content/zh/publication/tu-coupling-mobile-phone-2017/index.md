abstract: Understanding urban functions and their relationships with human activities
  has great implications for smart and sustainable urban development. In this study,
  we present a novel approach to uncovering urban functions by aggregating human activities
  inferred from mobile phone positioning and social media data. First, the homes and
  workplaces (of travelers) are estimated from mobile phone positioning data to annotate
  the activities conducted at these locations. The remaining activities (such as shopping,
  schooling, transportation, recreation and entertainment) are labeled using a hidden
  Markov model with social knowledge learned from social media check-in data over
  a lengthy period. By aggregating identified human activities, hourly urban functions
  are inferred, and the diurnal dynamics of those functions are revealed. An empirical
  analysis was conducted for the case of Shenzhen, China. The results indicate that
  the proposed approach can capture citywide dynamics of both human activities and
  urban functions. It also suggests that although many urban areas have been officially
  labeled with a single land-use type, they may provide different functions over time
  depending on the types and range of human activities. The study demonstrates that
  combining different data on human activities could yield an improved understanding
  of urban functions, which would benefit short-term urban decision-making and long-term
  urban policy making.
