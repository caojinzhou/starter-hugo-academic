abstract: Urban space and the behavior of human activities constantly interact with
  each other. Investigation on distribution of aggregated human activities and spatio-temporal
  change benefits data-driven policy-making in urban planning and urban governing.
  In the era of big data, with the development of information and communication technologies,
  it is possible to collect city-scale data with high resolution in space and time
  by various location-aware devices and sensors. Exploration of spatial-temporal activities
  attracts a lot of attention. By taking about 10 million one-day tracking data of
  mobile phone users in Shenzhen, China as an example, this paper firstly identified
  their stay locations according to spatial and temporal rules to generate stay trajectory
  for each individual and recovered activity semantic information by labelling activity
  types for each stay locations. Then, the significant differences in patterns of
  distributions of stay locations and their activities were analyzed. Spatial and
  temporal distributions of different human activities were explored, respectively.
  The study shows that the distribution of stay locations and activities is obviously
  heterogeneous. The average number of stay locations of an individual per day is
  2.1, while the average number of activities an individual engaged in per day is
  3.4. This study furthermore suggests that different types of activities have temporal
  variance and spatial heterogeneity. The temporal distribution fluctuates significantly
  over 24 hours, which is in accordance with daily routine. The spatial distribution
  overall obeys ``space power law'', and the spatial distribution of social activity,
  which has a faster-down tail, shows a more obvious pattern of spatial segregation
  than the other two activities. The study revealed the diversity and heterogeneity
  of spatial and temporal distribution of human aggregated activities in urban space,
  which is meaningful in analyzing human activities research and facilitating urban
  traffic optimization and urban planning.
