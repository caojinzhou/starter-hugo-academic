abstract: Closing mobility and accessibility gaps between public transit riders and
  private car users is key to tackling social exclusion and achieving sustainable
  development goals (SDGs). However, place-based potential accessibility methods do
  not accurately measure real gaps in the uptake of activity opportunities because
  people usually have limited activity spaces. This study introduces people-based
  activity space approaches to measure activity disparities between the two modal
  groups. To overcome difficulties in obtaining large-scale individual activity data,
  this study used vehicle plate recognition data and public transit smart card data
  to anonymously identify activities. Individual activity spaces were characterised
  by six primary activity features from different dimensions. The analysis confirmed
  that, relative to transit riders, people who use cars on average accessed more activities
  within a larger activity space and enjoyed overall higher travel efficiency. A comprehensive
  indicator was further derived from the primary activity features to quantify activity
  disparities at the zone level. Zones with the highest risk of social exclusion were
  observed in the outskirts. In contrast, the city centre and inner suburbs exhibited
  significant equality of the two transport modes in fulfilling mobility needs for
  engagement in activities. Activity disparities between the two modalities were determined
  per area in specific activity dimensions, namely activity extensity, activity diversity,
  and travel efficiency. Finally, statistical models provided evidence that public
  transport facilities (especially rail transit) and location factors (distance to
  the city centre) are essential in determining modality-associated gaps in access
  to urban activity opportunities. Socioeconomic status and land use diversity also
  partially contributed to the inequality in specific dimensions of the activity space.
  This people-centred approach is critical for tackling transport inequality and achieving
  SDGs while ``leaving no one behind''.
