	abstract = {Complex systems are very often organized under the form of networks where nodes and edges are embedded in space. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks, and neural networks, are all examples where space is relevant and where topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure and the evolution of spatial networks is thus crucial for many different fields, ranging from urbanism to epidemiology. An important consequence of space on networks is that there is a cost associated with the length of edges which in turn has dramatic effects on the topological structure of these networks. We will thoroughly explain the current state of our understanding of how the spatial constraints affect the structure and properties of these networks. We will review the most recent empirical observations and the most important models of spatial networks. We will also discuss various processes which take place on these spatial networks, such as phase transitions, random walks, synchronization, navigation, resilience, and disease spread.},

Visitors{\textquoteright} available time makes their visiting styles different, resulting in dissimilarity in the order and number of visited places and in path sequence length. We analyze all this by comparing a simulation model and observed data, which provide us the strength of the visitors{\textquoteright} mobility patterns. The obtained results indicate that shorter stay-type visitors exhibit stronger patterns than those with the longer stay-type, confirming that the former are more selective than the latter in terms of their visitation type.},

	abstract = {Modern technologies not only provide a variety of communication modes (e.g., texting, cell phone conversation, and online instant messaging), but also detailed electronic traces of these communications between individuals. These electronic traces indicate that the interactions occur in temporal bursts. Here, we study intercall duration of communications of the 100,000 most active cell phone users of a Chinese mobile phone operator. We confirm that the intercall durations follow a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff at the population level but find differences when focusing on individual users. We apply statistical tests at the individual level and find that the intercall durations follow a power-law distribution for only 3,460 individuals (3.46\%). The intercall durations for the majority (73.34\%) follow a Weibull distribution. We quantify individual users using three measures: out-degree, percentage of outgoing calls, and communication diversity. We find that the cell phone users with a power-law duration distribution fall into three anomalous clusters: robot-based callers, telecom fraud, and telephone sales. This information is of interest to both academics and practitioners, mobile telecom operators in particular. In contrast, the individual users with a Weibull duration distribution form the fourth cluster of ordinary cell phone users. We also discover more information about the calling patterns of these four clusters (e.g., the probability that a user will call the cr-th most contact and the probability distribution of burst sizes). Our findings may enable a more detailed analysis of the huge body of data contained in the logs of massive users.},

For instance, the distributions of the sizes of cities, earthquakes, forest fires, solar flares, moon craters and people's personal fortunes all appear to follow power laws.

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution{\textemdash}the part of the distribution representing large but rare events{\textemdash}and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

Our aim is to discover possible "universal laws" that can be related to the dynamical cognitive features of individuals. Analyzing the empirical trip length distribution we study if the travel time can be used as universal cost function in a mesoscopic model of mobility. We discuss the implications of the elapsed times distribution between successive trips that shows an underlying Benford's law, and we study the rank distribution of the average visitation frequency to understand how people organize their daily agenda. We also propose simple stochastic models to suggest possible explanations of the empirical observations and we compare our results with analogous results on statistical properties of human mobility presented in the literature.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of predicting evacuation mobility dynamics after large scale disasters for effective first response and disaster relief, our general understanding of evacuation behavior remains limited because of the lack of empirical evidence on the evacuation movement of individuals across multiple disaster instances. Here we investigate the GPS trajectories of a total of more than 1 million anonymized mobile phone users whose positions are tracked for a period of 2 months before and after four of the major earthquakes that occurred in Japan. Through a cross comparative analysis between the four disaster instances, we find that in contrast with the assumed complexity of evacuation decision making mechanisms in crisis situations, the individuals' evacuation probability is strongly dependent on the seismic intensity that they experience. In fact, we show that the evacuation probabilities in all earthquakes collapse into a similar pattern, with a critical threshold at around seismic intensity 5.5. This indicates that despite the diversity in the earthquakes profiles and urban characteristics, evacuation behavior is similarly dependent on seismic intensity. Moreover, we found that probability density functions of the distances that individuals evacuate are not dependent on seismic intensities that individuals experience. These insights from empirical analysis on evacuation from multiple earthquake instances using large scale mobility data contributes to a deeper understanding of how people react to earthquakes, and can potentially assist decision makers to simulate and predict the number of evacuees in urban areas with little computational time and cost, by using population density information and seismic intensity which can be observed instantaneously after the shock.},

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

The implication is that a small proportion of customers (or donors) are accountable for a very large share of sales turnover or income. This paper examines the impact on fundraising of the pioneering work of Vilfredo Pareto (1848{\textendash}1923) concerning the distribution of wealth between groups in society, which was first published exactly one hundred years ago, in 1895. It discusses the relevance of Pareto's Law to contemporary fundraising, using case data from UK charities who have put Pareto's assertions to the test. The recognition of the Pareto principle is wholly dependent on data analysis and software tools to perform the calculations and then display Pareto-style reports. Such tools are beginning to be seen in UK and some overseas software packages and general tools, available in the UK nonprofit marketplace. Illustrations of software systems supporting Pareto-style diagnostic analysis are given. At its most basic, Pareto's principle compels fundraisers to look into their databases of supporters to identify the small but potent {\'e}lite donating segments who always seem to exist among the general mass. The implications for fundraising that flow from such analyses are important and can be far-reaching. They allow fundamental supporter segmentation patterns based on historic donating history to be understood, and, if understood, managed productively. Finally, Pareto compels the decision to alter either fundraising management and allocation of resources, or to manage supporters, rather than appeals, which in the UK continues to be the most common management style.},

Existing empirical evidence suggests that Zipf{\textquoteright}s law is not always observable even for the upper-tail cities of a territory. However, the controversy with empirical findings arises due to sample selection biases, methodological weaknesses and data limitations. The hypothesis of Zipf{\textquoteright}s law is more likely to be rejected for the entire city size distribution and, in such case, alternative distributions have been suggested. On the contrary, the hypothesis is more likely to be accepted if better empirical methods are employed and cities are properly defined. The debate is still far from to be conclusive. In addition, we identify four emerging areas in Zipf{\textquoteright}s law and city size distribution research including the size distribution of lower-tail cities, the size distribution of cities in sub-national regions, the alternative forms of Zipf{\textquoteright}s law, and the relationship between Zipf{\textquoteright}s law and the coherence property of the urban system.},

This diversity raises the possibility that L{\'e}vy flights may be found in biological systems. A decade ago, it was proposed that L{\'e}vy flights may be observed in the behaviour of foraging ants3. Recently, it was argued that Drosophila might perform L{\'e}vy flights4, but the hypothesis that foraging animals in natural environments perform L{\'e}vy flights has not been tested. Here we study the foraging behaviour of the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, and find a power-law distribution of flight-time intervals. We interpret our finding of temporal scale invariance in terms of a scale-invariant spatial distribution of food on the ocean surface.

	abstract = {Recent technical advances have made high-fidelity tracking of populations possible. However, these datasets, such as GPS traces, can be comprised of millions of records, well beyond what even a skilled analyst can digest. To facilitate human analysis, these records are often expressed as aggregate distributions capturing behaviors of interest. While these aggregate distributions can provide substantial insight, the spatio-temporal resolution at which they are captured can impact the shape of the resulting distribution. We present an analysis of five spatial datasets, and codify the impact of rebinning the data at different spatio-temporal resolutions. We find that all aggregate metrics considered are affected by rebinning, but that some distributions do so regularly and predictably, while others do not. This work provides important insight into which metrics can be used to compare human behavior across datasets and the kinds of relationships between that can be expected.},

	abstract = {Wedding mobile phone sensor technology and human spatial behaviour has great potential. The ubiquity of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology has made gathering data about human mobility simpler, more precise, and with higher fidelity, providing minute-by-minute records of the locations of cohorts from dozens of participants. While this data provides a strong basis for Geographic Information Science research, it also constitutes an invasion of the participants{\textquoteright} privacy and can provide more information than researchers require to answer their questions. As an ethical and practical consideration, researchers should gather only as much data as they need. In this paper, we take three weeks of GPS traces from over a hundred student participants in mobile phone-based tracking studies and show that fewer than 14 days of data is necessary to establish complete activity spaces. We define {\textquoteleft}complete{\textquoteright} as the point at which marginal information gains become negligible according to a pairwise temporal analysis of the Kullback{\textendash}Leibler (KL) divergence of the spatial (bivariate) histogram through time. For the fixed level of information difference, observable in the data, impacts due to individual variability, population composition, and spatial resolution are evident. However, all populations at each level of resolution examined in the paper demonstrated convergence to low divergence levels occurred within a matter of days, and to negligible information gain in less than two weeks. The methods described in the paper represent a novel metric useful to understand the interaction between measurements and information in human mobility.},

	abstract = {Credit scoring is without a doubt one of the oldest applications of analytics. In recent years, a multitude of sophisticated classification techniques have been developed to improve the statistical performance of credit scoring models. Instead of focusing on the techniques themselves, this paper leverages alternative data sources to enhance both statistical and economic model performance. The study demonstrates how including call networks, in the context of positive credit information, as a new Big Data source has added value in terms of profit by applying a profit measure and profit-based feature selection. A unique combination of datasets, including call-detail records, credit and debit account information of customers is used to create scorecards for credit card applicants. Call-detail records are used to build call networks and advanced social network analytics techniques are applied to propagate influence from prior defaulters throughout the network to produce influence scores. The results show that combining call-detail records with traditional data in credit scoring models significantly increases their performance when measured in AUC. In terms of profit, the best model is the one built with only calling behavior features. In addition, the calling behavior features are the most predictive in other models, both in terms of statistical and economic performance. The results have an impact in terms of ethical use of call-detail records, regulatory implications, financial inclusion, as well as data sharing and privacy.},

	abstract = {Previous studies suggest that human mobility is highly regular in two respects. Firstly, individual's travels are governed by occasional exploration of new locations and preferential return to most frequently visited locations. Secondly, human mobility sequences exhibit high predictability. The existing model [1] is able to mimic exploration and preferential return, and lit actual mobility data. However, the high predictability issue is not addressed in this model. In this paper, we derive an upper bound of the predictability manifested by this model. Motivated by the incorrigible gap between the bound and the empirical results shown in [2], we further propose a new Markovian model by modifying the rule of preferential return to be conditional on the individuals' current location. We show both theoretically and empirically that the new Markovian model presents high predictability while preserving the desirable scaling properties of the original model in [1], making it the most complete model to date in capturing the essence of human mobility.},

In developing countries, collecting data on basic economic quantities, such as wealth and income, is costly, time-consuming, and unreliable. Taking advantage of the ubiquity of mobile phones in Rwanda, Blumenstock et al. mapped mobile phone metadata inputs to individual phone subscriber wealth. They applied the model to predict wealth throughout Rwanda and show that the predictions matched well with those from detailed boots-on-the-ground surveys of the population.
Science, this issue p. 1073
Accurate and timely estimates of population characteristics are a critical input to social and economic research and policy. In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer sources of big data exist. We show that an individual{\textquoteright}s past history of mobile phone use can be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions composed of just a few households. In resource-constrained environments where censuses and household surveys are rare, this approach creates an option for gathering localized and timely information at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.
Metadata from individuals{\textquoteright} phones can be used to predict aggregate-level characteristics such as access to electricity.

Significantly, the estimated travel demands not only preserved the distribution of travel demands, but also captured real-time bursts of mobility fluxes during large crowding events.

	abstract = {Background: Mobile devices are increasingly used to collect location-based information from individuals about their physical activities, dietary intake, environmental exposures, and mental well-being. Such research, which typically uses wearable devices or mobile phones to track location, benefits from the growing availability of fine-grained data regarding human mobility. However, little is known about the comparative geospatial accuracy of such devices. Objective: In this study, we compared the data quality of location information collected from two mobile devices that determine location in different ways{\textemdash}a global positioning system (GPS) watch and a mobile phone with Google{\textquoteright}s Location History feature enabled. Methods: A total of 21 chronically ill participants carried both devices, which generated digital traces of locations, for 28 days. A mobile phone{\textendash}based brief ecological momentary assessment (EMA) survey asked participants to manually report their location at 4 random times throughout each day. Participants also took part in qualitative interviews and completed surveys twice during the study period in which they reviewed recent mobile phone and watch trace data to compare the devices{\textquoteright} trace data with their memory of their activities on those days. Trace data from the devices were compared on the basis of (1) missing data days, (2) reasons for missing data, (3) distance between the route data collected for matching day and the associated EMA survey locations, and (4) activity space total area and density surfaces. Results: The watch resulted in a much higher proportion of missing data days (P{\textless}.001), with missing data explained by technical differences between the devices as well as participant behaviors. The mobile phone was significantly more accurate in detecting home locations (P=.004) and marginally more accurate (P=.07) for all types of locations combined. The watch data resulted in a smaller activity space area and more accurately recorded outdoor travel and recreation. Conclusions: The most suitable mobile device for location-based health research depends on the particular study objectives. Furthermore, data generated from mobile devices, such as GPS phones and smartwatches, require careful analysis to ensure quality and completeness. Studies that seek precise measurement of outdoor activity and travel, such as measuring outdoor physical activity or exposure to localized environmental hazards, would benefit from the use of GPS devices. Conversely, studies that aim to account for time within buildings at home or work, or those that document visits to particular places (such as supermarkets, medical facilities, or fast food restaurants), would benefit from the greater precision demonstrated by the mobile phone in recording indoor activities.

The concepts suggested for the description of the resolution of observation and observation collections are turned into ontology design patterns, which can be used for the annotation of current observations with their spatial and temporal resolution.},

	abstract = {Currently, smart card data analytics has caused new insights of human mobility patterns. Many applications of smart card data analytics, which have been applied from the bus traffic operation optimization to the traffic network optimization. Although the human travel behavioral features have been observed and revealed based on these statistical data, the diversity and dynamics are fundamental features of mobility data, requiring an in-depth understanding of the dynamic temporal-spatial features of these patterns. This paper measures the diversity and dynamics of human mobility patterns based on the smart card data of Chongqing. First, from individual mobility patterns, the measurement results indicate that the mobility patterns of urban passengers are similar during weekdays, but there is a distinct difference between weekdays and weekends. Second, based on the aggregated mobility patterns, each station has its own temporal profile. Specifically, the profiles of some stations are similar, because the land use types around these stations are identical. Third, based on the complex network theory, stations are divided into different clusters in a temporal scale. Interestingly, though clusters of stations are changing over time, adjacent stations which with close ids are always in the same cluster, because these stations are close to each other in geography. The above findings can help policymakers to make appropriate scheduling strategies and improve the efficiency of public transportation.},

	abstract = {2012 Reprint of 1949 Edition. Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. The principle of least effort is a broad theory that covers diverse fields from evolutionary biology to webpage design. It postulates that animals, people, even well designed machines will naturally choose the path of least resistance or "effort". This is perhaps best known or at least documented among researchers in the field of library and information science. Their principle states that an information seeking client will tend to use the most convenient search method, in the least exacting mode available. Information seeking behavior stops as soon as minimally acceptable results are found. This theory holds true regardless of the user's proficiency as a searcher, or their level of subject expertise. The principle of least effort is analogous to the path of least resistance. The principle was studied by linguist George Kingsley Zipf, author of this classic treatment of the subject. He theorized that the distribution of word use was due to the tendency to communicate efficiently with least effort and this theory is known as Zipf's Law.},

	abstract = {With the recent increase in urban population worldwide, and the emergence of big data analytics, there is a growing interest in research on how cities are actively reconstructing themselves into a smart and sustainable city. Research studies have shown that the smart city system primarily focuses on integrating three components: economic, environmental, and social. The social component includes participatory democracy with citizen engagement. In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of {\textquoteleft}sense{\textquoteright}, {\textquoteleft}seize{\textquoteright}, {\textquoteleft}align{\textquoteright}, and {\textquoteleft}transform{\textquoteright} functions. Our case study focuses on the {\textquoteleft}sense{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}seize{\textquoteright} steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights. Our approach has the potential to assist policy makers in designing a comprehensive strategy toward the goal of the smart city.},

While such measures are important to provide insights into the functional patterns of a city, novel quantitative methods, derived from ubiquitous mobile connectivity, are needed to provide policy-makers with better insights to improve urban management and planning decisions. In this paper, we develop a model that uses large-scale WiFi probe request data to model urban mobility trajectories in dense urban environments. We collect probe request data from a public Wifi network with 54 access points in the Lower Manhattan section of New York City over one week, accounting for more than 30 million observations and over 800,000 unique devices. First, we aggregate unique entries per access point and per hour, demonstrating the potential to use WiFi data to approximate local population counts by type of user. We then use a spatial network analysis to identify edge frequencies and directions of journeys between the network nodes, and apply the results to the road and pedestrian sidewalk network to identify usage intensity levels and trajectories for individual street segments. We demonstrate the significant potential in the use of WiFi probe request data for understanding mobility patterns in cities, while highlighting non-trivial issues in data privacy raised by the growing availability of public WiFi networks.},

	abstract = {The rapidly developing economy and growing urbanization in China have created the largest rural-to-urban migration in human history. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the pattern of rural flight and its prevalence and magnitude over the country is increasingly important for sociological and political concerns. Because of the limited availability of internal migration data, which was derived previously from the decennial population census and small-scale household survey, we could not obtain timely and consistent observations for rural depopulation dynamics across the whole country. In this study, we use aggregate location-aware data collected from mobile location requests in the largest Chinese social media platform during the period of the 2016 Chinese New Year to conduct a nationwide estimate of rural depopulation in China (in terms of the grid cell-level prevalence and the magnitude) based on the world{\textquoteright}s largest travel period. Our results suggest a widespread rural flight likely occurring in 60.2\% (36.5\%-81.0\%, lower-upper estimate) of rural lands at the grid cell-level and covering {\textasciitilde}1.55 (1.48{\textendash}1.94) million villages and hamlets, most of China{\textquoteright}s rural settlement sites. Moreover, we find clear regional variations in the magnitude and spatial extent of the estimated rural depopulation. These variations are likely connected to regional differences in the size of the source population, largely because of the nationwide prevalence of rural flight in today{\textquoteright}s China. Our estimate can provide insights into related investigations of China{\textquoteright}s rural depopulation and the potential of increasingly available crowd-sourced data for demographic studies.},

The predictive performance of models in literature varies quite broadly, from over 90\% to under 40\%. In this work we study which underlying factors - in terms of modeling approaches and spatio-temporal characteristics of the data sources - have resulted in this remarkably broad span of performance reported in the literature. Specifically we investigate which factors influence the accuracy of next-place prediction, using a high-precision location dataset of more than 400 users observed for periods between 3 months and one year. We show that it is much easier to achieve high accuracy when predicting the time-bin location than when predicting the next place. Moreover, we demonstrate how the temporal and spatial resolution of the data have strong influence on the accuracy of prediction. Finally we reveal that the exploration of new locations is an important factor in human mobility, and we measure that on average 20-25\% of transitions are to new places, and approx. 70\% of locations are visited only once. We discuss how these mechanisms are important factors limiting our ability to predict human mobility.},

Even though a variety of works have investigated the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks, empirical data that validates the determinant coupling factors are still lacking. In this paper, we employ smartcard data of 2.4 million subway and bus passengers in Shenzhen, China to study the coupling dynamics of subway and bus networks. Surprisingly, the coupling of subway and bus networks is not notably influenced by the time-varying speed ratio of the two network layers but is jointly determined by the distribution of travel demands and transportation facilities. Our findings highlight the important role of real travel demand data in analyzing the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks. They also suggest that the speed ratio of different network layers, which was regarded as a key factor in determining coupling strength, has a negligible effect on travelers{\textquoteright} route selections, and thus the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks.},

	abstract = {As users of mobile devices make phone calls, browse the web, or use an app, large volumes of data are routinely generated that are a potentially useful source for investigating human behavior in space. However, as such data are usually collected only as a by-product, they often lack stringent experimental design and ground truth, which makes interpretation and derivation of valid behavioral conclusions challenging. Here, we propose an unsupervised, data-driven approach to identify different user types based on high-resolution human movement data collected from a smartphone navigation app, in the absence of ground truth. We capture spatio-temporal footprints of users, characterized by meaningful summary statistics, which are then used in an unsupervised step to identify user types. Based on an extensive dataset of users of the mobile navigation app Sygic in Australia, we show how the proposed methodology allows to identify two distinct groups of users: {\textquoteleft}travelers{\textquoteright}, visiting different areas with distinct, salient characteristics, and {\textquoteleft}locals{\textquoteright}, covering shorter distances and revisiting many of their locations. We verify our approach by relating user types to space use: we find that travelers and locals prefer to visit distinct, different locations in the Australian cities Sydney and Melbourne, as suggested independently by other studies. Although we use high-resolution GPS data, the proposed methodology is potentially transferable to low-resolution movement data (e.g. Call Detail Records), since we rely only on summary statistics.},

	abstract = {Estimating revenue and business demand of a newly opened venue is paramount as these early stages often involve critical decisions such as first rounds of staffing and resource allocation. Traditionally, this estimation has been performed through coarse-grained measures such as observing numbers in local venues or venues at similar places (e.g., coffee shops around another station in the same city). The advent of crowdsourced data from devices and services carried by individuals on a daily basis has opened up the possibility of performing better predictions of temporal visitation patterns for locations and venues. In this paper, using mobility data from Foursquare, a location-centric platform, we treat venue categories as proxies for urban activities and analyze how they become popular over time. The main contribution of this work is a prediction framework able to use characteristic temporal signatures of places together with k-nearest neighbor metrics capturing similarities among urban regions, to forecast weekly popularity dynamics of a new venue establishment in a city neighborhood. We further show how we are able to forecast the popularity of the new venue after one month following its opening by using locality and temporal similarity as features. For the evaluation of our approach we focus on London. We show that temporally similar areas of the city can be successfully used as inputs of predictions of the visit patterns of new venues, with an improvement of 41\% compared to a random selection of wards as a training set for the prediction task. We apply these concepts of temporally similar areas and locality to the real-time predictions related to new venues and show that these features can effectively be used to predict the future trends of a venue. Our findings have the potential to impact the design of location-based technologies and decisions made by new business owners.},

	abstract = {Traditional crime prediction models based on census data are limited, as they fail to capture the complexity and dynamics of human activity. With the rise of ubiquitous computing, there is the opportunity to improve such models with data that make for better proxies of human presence in cities. In this paper, we leverage large human mobility data to craft an extensive set of features for crime prediction, as informed by theories in criminology and urban studies. We employ averaging and boosting ensemble techniques from machine learning, to investigate their power in predicting yearly counts for different types of crimes occurring in New York City at census tract level. Our study shows that spatial and spatio-temporal features derived from Foursquare venues and checkins, subway rides, and taxi rides, improve the baseline models relying on census and POI data. The proposed models achieve absolute R 2 \$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ metrics of up to 65\% (on a geographical out-of-sample test set) and up to 89\% (on a temporal out-of-sample test set). This proves that, next to the residential population of an area, the ambient population there is strongly predictive of the area{\textquoteright}s crime levels. We deep-dive into the main crime categories, and find that the predictive gain of the human dynamics features varies across crime types: such features bring the biggest boost in case of grand larcenies, whereas assaults are already well predicted by the census features. Furthermore, we identify and discuss top predictive features for the main crime categories. These results offer valuable insights for those responsible for urban policy or law enforcement.},

Extensive researches concerning mobile phone data have been performed with the increasing widespread use of mobile phones.

In this research, mobile phone call record data (CRD) of 60 days obtained from Shenzhen, China has been put into use. By identifying the home and work location for users, location information for every timeslot was labeled. First, mobility topic was extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Then, affinity propagation (AP) was used to analyze users{\textquoteright} mobility patterns from mobility topic distribution. The results revealed that clustering on the level of mobility topic outperformed directly clustering location sequence information. This method could effectively mitigate the adverse impact brought by missing information. Finally, 25 and 17 patterns are found in weekday and weekend, respectively. Representative features were captured from each pattern. By measuring the accuracy of the representative feature, it can be concluded that mobility feature after clustering is capable of describing the main mobility patterns.},

The stations are divided into 10 groups that are classified under three categories: employment-oriented, dual-peak, and residence-oriented stations. We analyze how these categories differ in terms of station-level passenger flow. In addition, a station-level buffer area calculation method is used to estimate the land-use density around each subway station. Considering the spatial nonstationarity of passenger flow, we employ a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to determine the correlation effect between peak-hour passenger flow and land-use density. We then analyze the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients. Results demonstrate that most residents commute via rail transportation, and the passenger flows for the different categories of stations exhibit distinct characteristics of residences and workplaces. The findings of this study provide insightful information and theoretical foundation for rail transportation network design and operation management.},

	abstract = {We examine the non-Markovian nature of human mobility by exposing the inability of Markov models to capture criticality in human mobility. In particular, the assumed Markovian nature of mobility was used to establish a theoretical upper bound on the predictability of human mobility (expressed as a minimum error probability limit), based on temporally correlated entropy. Since its inception, this bound has been widely used and empirically validated using Markov chains. We show that recurrent-neural architectures can achieve significantly higher predictability, surpassing this widely used upper bound. In order to explain this anomaly, we shed light on several underlying assumptions in previous research works that has resulted in this bias. By evaluating the mobility predictability on real-world datasets, we show that human mobility exhibits scale-invariant long-range correlations, bearing similarity to a power-law decay. This is in contrast to the initial assumption that human mobility follows an exponential decay. This assumption of exponential decay coupled with Lempel-Ziv compression in computing Fano's inequality has led to an inaccurate estimation of the predictability upper bound. We show that this approach inflates the entropy, consequently lowering the upper bound on human mobility predictability. We finally highlight that this approach tends to overlook long-range correlations in human mobility. This explains why recurrent-neural architectures that are designed to handle long-range structural correlations surpass the previously computed upper bound on mobility predictability.},

The undertaken substantial parameters are inter-event times, travel distances (displacements) and radius of gyration. They have been analyzed and simulated using computing platform by integrating various applications for huge database management, visualization, analysis, and simulation. Accordingly, the general population pattern law has been extracted. The study contribution outcomes have revealed both the individuals densities in static perspective and individuals mobility in dynamic perspective with multi levels of abstraction (macroscopic, mesoscopic, microscopic).},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of cities is in the heart of many applications including urban planning, zoning, and real-estate construction. So far, much of our understanding about urban dynamics came from traditional surveys conducted by persons or by leveraging mobile data in the form of Call Detailed Records. However, the high financial and human cost associated with these methods make the data availability very limited. In this paper, we investigate the use of large scale and publicly available user contributed content, in the form of social media posts to understand the urban dynamics of cities. We build activity time series for different cities, and different neighborhoods within the same city to identify the different dynamic patterns taking place. Next, we conduct a cluster analysis on the time series to understand the spatial distribution of patterns in the city. Our instantiation for the two cities of London and Doha shows the effectiveness of our method.},

Recent United Nations and landmark Nature publications highlight the global uptake of mobile technology and the staggering potential for big data to encourage people to be physically active and to influence health policy. However, concerns exist about inconsistencies in smartphone health apps. Big data has many benefits, but noisy data may lead to wrong conclusions. In reaction to the increasing availability of low quality data; we call for a rigorous debate into the validity of substituting big data for accurate data in health research. We evaluated the step counting accuracy of a smartphone app previously used by 717,527 people from 111 countries. Our new data (from 48 participants; aged 21{\textendash}59 years; body mass index 17.7{\textendash}33.5 kg/m2) revealed significant (15{\textendash}66\%) undercounting by Apple phones. In contrast to the generally positive performances of wearable devices for stereotypical treadmill like walking, we observed extraordinarily large (0{\textendash}200\% of steps taken) error ranges for both Android and Apple phones. Unconscious bias (developers{\textquoteright} perceptions of usual behaviour) may be embedded into many unvalidated smartphone apps. Consumer-grade wearable devices appear unsuitable to detect steps in people with slow, short or non-stereotypical gait patterns. Specifically, there is a risk of systematically undercounting the steps by obese people, females or people from different ethnic groups resulting in biases when reporting associations between physical inactivity and obesity. More research is required to develop smartphone apps suitable for all people of the heterogeneous global population.},

	abstract = {The urbanization and motorization of Chinese cities follow divergent trajectories. However, how the diversity occurred, particularly within the small and medium cities, is understudied. Using panel data from 287 cities from 2001 to 2014 and a time-series clustering method, this study identified representative trajectories along which Chinese cities were urbanized and motorized. Urbanization was measured by scale, wealth, urban form, and infrastructure; motorization by automobile, taxi, bus numbers, and subway lines. Chinese cities were classified into four clusters: 23 Cluster-1 cities were the large cities with heavy rails; 41 Cluster-2 cities were the low-density wealthy cities with auto-oriented mobility; 134 Cluster-3 cities were the low-density medium-wealth cities with moderate mobility levels; and 89 Cluster-4 cities were the high-density poor cities with lowest mobility levels. Comparing to the traditional three-tier structure, exclusively based on political tiers, the four-cluster structure respects the multi-dimensional nature of cities and reflects the essential diversities among the medium and small cities. While political tiers remain critical, other features including scale, density, infrastructure, and mobility patterns are also important: scale differentiates Cluster-1 from others; low density characterizes Clusters 2 and 3; heavy rail and auto-oriented mobility respectively identify Clusters 1 and 2. We contribute to China{\textquoteright}s urban development literature by explicitly examining the temporal dimension, analyzing both urbanization and motorization, and incorporating all the medium and small cities in China. The distinct patterns of Clusters 2, 3, and 4 are evident, and the variation within them were as important as that between them and large cities.},

This study seeks to analyze the pattern and process of urban expansion at Sylhet Sadar Upazila from 1981 to 2016 by extracting impervious land-cover from satellite images and using Shannon{\textquoteright}s entropy. To find out a comparatively accurate method of extracting impervious land-cover from satellite images, three classification methods viz., supervised maximum likelihood algorithms, index-based classification and neural classification are experimenting with a single Landsat images of 2016. A method is selected on the basis of accuracy measures. The study finds the neural classification can extract impervious land-cover accurately (about 90\% accuracy) than other classification. This classification method is adopted to classify the Landsat images of 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011 and the amount of impervious land-cover is estimated in ArcGIS platform. Finally, the entropy value is calculated using the amount of impervious land-cover for each union and city corporation. Up to 2011, the city expands mainly along north-south direction and this expansion occurs at northen and eastern direction after 2011. The urban expansion in Sylhet city and its vicinity is scattered in nature but the compactness increases slightly in 2016. Number of Population and elevation acted as the driving force of urban expansion in case of Sylhet city.},

In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for the fusion of measured data for detecting and predicting weather-driven natural hazards. The proposed research introduces a robust theoretical and algorithmic framework for the fusion of heterogeneous data in near real time. We establish a flexible information-based fusion framework with a target optimality criterion of choice, which for illustration, is specialized to a maximum entropy principle and a least effort principle for semisupervised learning with noisy labels. We develop a methodology to account for multimodality data and a solution for addressing inherent sensor limitations. In our case study of interest, namely, that of flood density estimation, we further show that by fusing remote sensing and social media data, we can develop well founded and actionable flood maps. This capability is valuable in situations where environmental hazards, such as hurricanes or severe weather, affect very large areas. Relative to the state of the art working with such data, our proposed information-theoretic solution is principled and systematic, while offering a joint exploitation of any set of heterogeneous sensor modalities with minimally assuming priors. This flexibility is coupled with the ability to quantitatively and clearly state the fusion principles with very reasonable computational costs. The proposed method is tested and substantiated with the multimodality data of a 2013 Boulder Colorado flood event.},

Without docking stations, this system allows the sharing bike to be parked in any proper places. This study aimed to develop a dynamic demand forecasting model for station-free bike sharing using the deep learning approach. The spatial and temporal analyses were first conducted to investigate the mobility pattern of the station-free bike sharing. The result indicates the imbalanced spatial and temporal demand of bike sharing trips. The long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM NNs) were then developed to predict the bike sharing trip production and attraction at TAZ for different time intervals, including the 10-min, 15-min, 20-min and 30-min intervals. The validation results suggested that the developed LSTM NNs have reasonable good prediction accuracy in trip productions and attractions for different time intervals. The statistical models and recently developed machine learning methods were also developed to benchmark the LSTM NN. The comparison results suggested that the LSTM NNs provide better prediction accuracy than both conventional statistical models and advanced machine learning methods for different time intervals. The developed LSTM NNs can be used to predict the gap between the inflow and outflow of the sharing bike trips at a TAZ, which provide useful information for rebalancing the sharing bike in the system.},

We developed a method of mapping the winter and summer on-road PM2.5 concentrations along a tramcar route at a 50-m spatial resolution, using mobile measurements. In addition, the minimum number of days required to precisely estimate on-road PM2.5 concentrations was estimated. The results showed that the on-road PM2.5 concentrations were highly correlated with PM2.5 concentrations measured at a nearby roadside air quality monitoring station (AQMS) in both winter and summer, with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.89{\textendash}0.93. The resulting maps of winter and summer on-road PM2.5 concentrations revealed small-scale spatial patterns used to identify more polluted areas. In addition, approximately 12 and 4 days were required to precisely capture spatial patterns of PM2.5 concentrations, with R2 higher than 0.6 in winter and in summer. The findings of this study offer valuable information on air pollution control and exposure reduction by highlighting localized pollution hotspots, and provide insights into the minimum sampling duration for mobile sampling campaigns.},

In this paper, aiming to help improving sustainability in multimodal transportation through BSS, we perform a systematic data analysis to examine underlying patterns and characteristics of the system dynamics in a bikeshare network and to acquire implications of the patterns and characteristics for decision making. As a case study, we use trip history data from the Capital Bikeshare system in the Washington DC area and some additional data sources. The study covers seven important aspects of bikeshare transportation systems, which are respectively trip demand and flow, operating activities, use and idle times, trip purpose, origin-destination flows, mobility, and safety. For these aspects, by using appropriate statistical methods and geographic techniques, we investigate travel patterns and characteristics of BSS from data to evaluate the qualitative and quantitative impacts of the inputs from key stakeholders on main measures of effectiveness such as trip costs, mobility, safety, quality of service, and operational efficiency, where key stakeholders include road users, system operators, and city. We also disclose some new patterns and characteristics of BSS to advance the knowledge on travel behaviors. Finally, we briefly summarize our findings and discuss the implications of the patterns and characteristics for data-driven decision supports from the relations between BSS and key stakeholders for promoting bikeshare utilization and transforming urban transportation to be more sustainable.},

We consider data traffic as reflection of human activities due to its timeliness and pervasiveness. During the process we also propose two possible indicators from traffic flows to build bridge between data traffic and human activities. We apply our technique to real-world mobile data traffic collected by major mobile operators in China.

	abstract = {Background: Call detail records (CDRs) are collected by mobile network operators in the course of providing their service. CDRs are increasingly being used in research along with other forms of big data and represent an emerging data type with potential for public good. Many jurisdictions have infrastructures for health data research that could benefit from the integration of CDRs with health data. Objective: The objective of this study was to review how CDRs have been used in health research and to identify challenges and potential opportunities for their wider use in conjunction with health data. Methods: A literature review was conducted using structured search terms making use of major search engines. Initially, 4066 items were identified. Following screening, 46 full text articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. Information extracted included research topic area, population of study, datasets used, information governance and ethical considerations, study findings, and data limitations. Results: The majority of published studies were focused on low-income and middle-income countries. Making use of the location element in CDRs, studies often modeled the transmission of infectious diseases or estimated population movement following natural disasters with a view to implementing interventions. CDRs were used in anonymized or aggregated form, and the process of gaining regulatory approvals varied with data provider and by jurisdiction. None included public views on the use of CDRs in health research. Conclusions: Despite various challenges and limitations, anonymized mobile phone CDRs have been used successfully in health research. The use of aggregated data is a safeguard but also a further limitation. Greater opportunities could be gained if validated anonymized CDRs were integrated with routine health records at an individual level, provided that permissions and safeguards could be put in place. Further work is needed, including gaining public views, to develop an ethically founded framework for the use of CDRs in health research.  [JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2018;6(7):e161]},

	abstract = {Animal movements are typically driven by areas of supply and demand for animal products and by the seasonality of production and demand. As animals can potentially spread infectious diseases, disease prevention can benefit from a better understanding of the factors influencing movements patterns in space and time. In Mauritania, an important cultural event, called the Tabaski (A{\"i}d el Kebir) strongly affects timing and structure of movements, and due to the arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, the season can also influence movement patterns. In order to better characterize the animal movements patterns, a survey was carried out in 2014, and those data were analysed here using social network analysis (SNA) metrics and used to train predictive gravity models. More specifically, we aimed to contrast the movements structure by ruminant species, season (Tabaski vs. Non-Tabaski) and mode of transport (truck vs. foot). The networks differed according to the species, and to the season, with a changed proportion of truck vs. foot movements. The gravity models were able to predict the probability of a movement link between two locations with moderate to good accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.76 to 0.97), according to species, seasons, and mode of transport, but we failed to predict the traded volume of those trade links. The significant predictor variables of a movement link were the human and sheep population at the source and origin, and the distance separating the locations. Though some improvements would be needed to predict traded volumes and better account for the barriers to mobility, the results provide useful predictions to inform epidemiological models in space and time, and, upon external validation, could be useful to predict movements at a larger regional scale.},

They support analysis, facilitate qualitative and quantitative predictions, and synthesize behaviors for simulations. One promising approach to crowd modeling relies on micro-level agent-based simulations, where the interactions of simulated individual agents in the crowd result in macro-level crowd dynamics which are the object of study. This article reports on an agent-based model of urban pedestrian crowds, where culture is explicitly modeled. We extend an established agent-based social agent model, inspired by social psychology, to account for individual cultural attributes discussed in social science literature. We then embed the model in a simulation of pedestrians and explore the resulting macro-level crowd behaviors, such as pedestrian flow, lane changes rate, and so on. We validate the model by quantitatively comparing the simulation results to the pedestrian dynamics in movies of human crowds in five different countries: Iraq, Israel, England, Canada, and France. We conclude that the model can faithfully replicate urban pedestrians in different cultures. Encouraged by these results, we explore simulations of mixed-culture pedestrian crowds.},

	abstract = {Smart City: Challenges and Opportunities-Experiences from European Smart Cities Projects Cities globally embody the challenge of how to improve competitiveness while achieving social cohesion and environmental sustainability. Cities are fertile ground for science and technology, innovation and cultural activity, but at the same time, they are also places where problems such as environmental pollution, unemployment, segregation and poverty are concentrated. Complex problems like these require a holistic approach to urban development, together with an assessment of urban policies in terms of a comprehensive set of socio-economic and environmental indicators. Smart city governance innovations are redefining the options and opportunities for city governance and planning globally. The interplay of societal and technological innovation provides a universal dynamic that is driving the generation of new models of integrated and participatory, inclusive and open governance. This dynamic is impacting and disrupting the existing orthodoxies of governance, and raising numerous questions for urban planning. What is the defining architecture of open, co-created and inclusive urban governance? What are the most effective transition pathways to this new urban governance? To what extent can common solutions and models of urban governance be applied universally and effective globally, defining a new industry business model? The presentation will draw upon extensive experience of EU funded research and innovation projects (FP7 and Horizon 2020) concerning open smart city governance. A principal point of reference and input aises from the Smarticipate ongoing experiment in the development of open governance solutions for urban planning in collaboration with the partner cities of Rome, London and Hamburg. Similarly practical city planning solutions supporting smart open governance will be showcased from a number of projects including urbanAPI, URBIS, and DECUMANUS, involving the development and implementation of smart city governance applications in major European cities including Helsinki, London, Antwerp, Milan, Bologna and Madrid, Amiens and Osnabruck.},

	abstract = {Traffic jam in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh and one of the most densely populated cities in the world, is one of the major problems of the commuters. The city dwellers have been experiencing intolerable traffic jam everyday. To reduce the traffic congestion, new roads have been built and new rules for vehicles in the roads have been enforced. These changes do not result in any visible improvement of the traffic condition. One major bottleneck for not being able to take appropriate measure for combating traffic jam is the inability to assess and predict the traffic condition of the road. Due to huge infrastructural cost, the city does not have facility to collect traffic data by deploying sensors. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by exploiting mobile phone call details record (CDR) data collected by mobile phone operators for billing purpose. We propose a methodology to estimate travel time between any two major locations of Dhaka city from the aggregated information of a high volume of users' mobile phone CDR data. Our experimental results on real CDR data set of 2.87 millions of users of the largest mobile operator, Grameenphone Ltd., show that we can effectively predict travel time between any two major junctions and any two minor locations of the city with an average accuracy of 87\% and 76\% respectively.},

We investigate the consequences of climate-related natural disasters for long-term population mobility in rural Bangladesh, a region particularly vulnerable to environmental change, using longitudinal survey data from 1,700 households spanning a 15-y period. Multivariate event history models are used to estimate the effects of flooding and crop failures on local population mobility and long-distance migration while controlling for a large set of potential confounders at various scales. The results indicate that flooding has modest effects on mobility that are most visible at moderate intensities and for women and the poor. However, crop failures unrelated to flooding have strong effects on mobility in which households that are not directly affected but live in severely affected areas are the most likely to move. These results point toward an alternate paradigm of disaster-induced mobility that recognizes the significant barriers to migration for vulnerable households as well their substantial local adaptive capacity.},

We selected fifteen destructive cases across five types of natural disaster and analyzed the human movement data before, during, and after each event, comparing the perturbed and steady state movement data. The results suggest that the power-law can describe human mobility in most cases and that human mobility patterns observed in steady states are often correlated with those in perturbed states, highlighting their inherent resilience. However, the quantitative analysis shows that this resilience has its limits and can fail in more powerful natural disasters. The findings from this study will deepen our understanding of the interaction between urban dwellers and civil infrastructure, improve our ability to predict human movement patterns during natural disasters, and facilitate contingency planning by policymakers.},

	abstract = {Human mobility is influenced by environmental change and natural disasters. Researchers have used trip distance distribution, radius of gyration of movements, and individuals' visited locations to understand and capture human mobility patterns and trajectories. However, our knowledge of human movements during natural disasters is limited owing to both a lack of empirical data and the low precision of available data. Here, we studied human mobility using high-resolution movement data from individuals in New York City during and for several days after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. We found the human movements followed truncated power-law distributions during and after Hurricane Sandy, although the $\beta$ value was noticeably larger during the first 24 hours after the storm struck. Also, we examined two parameters: the center of mass and the radius of gyration of each individual's movements. We found that their values during perturbation states and steady states are highly correlated, suggesting human mobility data obtained in steady states can possibly predict the perturbation state. Our results demonstrate that human movement trajectories experienced significant perturbations during hurricanes, but also exhibited high resilience. We expect the study will stimulate future research on the perturbation and inherent resilience of human mobility under the influence of hurricanes. For example, mobility patterns in coastal urban areas could be examined as hurricanes approach, gain or dissipate in strength, and as the path of the storm changes. Understanding nuances of human mobility under the influence of such disasters will enable more effective evacuation, emergency response planning and development of strategies and policies to reduce fatality, injury, and economic loss.},

People's daily activity patterns were inferred, such as place visited, the time this took place, the duration of the visit, based on the GPS location traces of their mobile phones overlaid upon Yellow Pages information. Our analysis of 31,855 mobile phone users allowed us to infer that people were more likely to stay longer at eateries or food outlets, and (to a lesser degree) at retail or shopping areas when the weather is very cold or when conditions are calm (non-windy). When compared to people's regular activity patterns, certain weather conditions affected people's movements and activities noticeably at different times of the day. On cold days, people's activities were found to be more diverse especially after 10AM, showing greatest variations between 2PM and 6PM. A similar trend is observed between 10AM and midnight on rainy days, with people's activities found to be most diverse on days with heaviest rainfalls or on days when the wind speed was stronger than 4 km/h, especially between 10AM{\textendash}1AM. Finally, we observed that different geographical areas of a large metropolis were impacted differently by the weather. Using data of urban infrastructure to characterize areas, we found strong correlations between weather conditions upon people's accessibility to trains. This study sheds new light on the influence of weather conditions on human behavior, in particular the choice of daily activities and how mobile phone data can be used to investigate the influence of environmental factors on urban dynamics.},

	abstract = {Globalisation and its attendant population flows have been increasingly politicised and securitised in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the European refugee crisis and the displacements of mostly Middle Eastern but also African and often Muslim populations due to regional conflicts and the emergence of ISIS. This political focus has obscured the broader picture of ever diversifying migratory patterns and the transformations these changes in migratory behaviour bring to migration systems globally. German migrations to Australia have a long and varied history ranging from well-respected community to enemy alien. In the twenty-first century, however, German mobile individuals represent characteristics of populations most likely to provide valuable insights into contemporary mobility processes and limitations as their capacity for mobility is relatively unconstrained; their mobility behaviour is influenced by educational, professional or lifestyle choices rather than necessity. On the other hand, their mobility cannot be reduced to either end of the migration continuum. They are neither cosmopolitan elites nor the displaced and marginalised migrants of the post-World War II migration waves. They are people who lead ordinary lives in which the crossing of an international border is just another building block in their elective biography. They view their cross-border relocation much like a move within their home country, where attachments, facilitated by technology, are transnational. Mobility trajectories of Germans to and from Australia can thus provide insight into contemporary patterns of ordinary mobility beyond structural limitations or limitless opportunity associated with affluent lifestyles.},

We propose a set of new entropy-based measures for human communication dynamics represented within the temporal social network as event sequences. Using real world datasets and random interaction series of different types we find that real human contact events always significantly differ from random ones. This human distinctiveness increases over time and by means of the proposed entropy measures, we can observe sociological processes that take place within dynamic communities.},

Recently, new data has become available which allows for the discovery of urban mobility patterns which differ from established results about long distance travel. Specifically, the latest evidence increasingly points to exponential trip length distributions, contrary to the scaling laws observed on larger scales. In this paper, in order to explore the origin of the exponential law, we propose a new model which can predict individual flows in urban areas better. Based on the model, we explain the exponential law of intra-urban mobility as a result of the exponential decrease in average population density in urban areas. Indeed, both empirical and analytical results indicate that the trip length and the population density share the same exponential decaying rate.},

This study represents a first step towards building a methodology whereby mobile phone data can be more usefully applied to transportation research. In this paper, we present techniques to extract useful mobility information from the mobile phone traces of millions of users to investigate individual mobility patterns within a metropolitan area. The mobile-phone-based mobility measures are compared to mobility measures computed using odometer readings from the annual safety inspections of all private vehicles in the region to check the validity of mobile phone data in characterizing individual mobility and to identify the differences between individual mobility and vehicular mobility. The empirical results can help us understand the intra-urban variation of mobility and the non-vehicular component of overall mobility. More importantly, this study suggests that mobile phone trace data represent a reasonable proxy for individual mobility and show enormous potential as an alternative and more frequently updatable data source and a compliment to the conventional travel surveys in mobility study.},

In this study we propose to enhance urban planning by taking into a consideration individual preferences using information from an unconventional big data source: dataset of geo-tagged photographs that people take in cities which we then use as a measure of urban attractiveness. We discover and compare a temporal behavior of residents and visitors in ten most photographed cities in the world. Looking at the periodicity in urban attractiveness, the results show that the strongest periodic patterns for visitors are usually weekly or monthly. Moreover, by dividing cities into two groups based on which continent they belong to (i.e., North America or Europe), it can be concluded that unlike European cities, behavior of visitors in the US cities in general is similar to the behavior of their residents. Finally, we apply two indices, called {\textquotedblleft}dilatation attractiveness index{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}dilatation index{\textquotedblright}, to our dataset which tell us the spatial and temporal attractiveness pulsations in the city. The proposed methodology is not only important for urban planning, but also does support various business and public stakeholder decision processes, concentrated for example around the question how to attract more visitors to the city or estimate the impact of special events organized there.},

Mobile phone data have been collected in eight cities in Northeast China and used to extract individuals{\textquoteright} movement trajectories. The massive mobile phone data provides a wide coverage and detailed depiction of individuals{\textquoteright} movement in space and time. Considering that most individuals{\textquoteright} movement is limited within particular urban areas, boundaries of urban agglomerations are demarcated based on the spatial distribution of mobile phone base towers. Results indicate that the distribution of human{\textquoteright}s intra-urban travel in general follows the exponential law. The exponents, however, vary from city to city and indicate the impact of city sizes and shapes. Individuals living in large or less compact cities generally need to travel farther on a daily basis, and vice versa. A Monte Carlo simulation analysis based on Levy flight is conducted to further examine and validate the relation between intra-urban human mobility and urban morphology.},

In this research, we combine activity-based analysis with a movement-based approach to model the intra-urban human mobility observed from about 15 million check-in records during a yearlong period in Shanghai, China. The proposed model is activity-based and includes two parts: the transition of travel demands during a specific time period and the movement between locations. For the first part, we find the transition probability between activities varies over time, and then we construct a temporal transition probability matrix to represent the transition probability of travel demands during a time interval. For the second part, we suggest that the travel demands can be divided into two classes, locationally mandatory activity (LMA) and locationally stochastic activity (LSA), according to whether the demand is associated with fixed location or not. By judging the combination of predecessor activity type and successor activity type we determine three trip patterns, each associated with a different decay parameter. To validate the model, we adopt the mechanism of an agent-based model and compare the simulated results with the observed pattern from the displacement distance distribution, the spatio-temporal distribution of activities, and the temporal distribution of travel demand transitions. The results show that the simulated patterns fit the observed data well, indicating that these findings open new directions for combining activity-based analysis with a movement-based approach using social media check-in data.},

A case study was conducted in the Kansas Metro Corridor to analyze the feasibility of using cell phone data to track cross-region (cities) traffic activities, and to derive the O-D traffic, travel demand by time-of-day and commuting traffic data along the traffic corridor based on a 6 week observation period. The results found that the available cell phone network data detected about 17.6\% of the daily traffic data compared to the AADT data along the Kansas Metro Corridor. Approximately 58\% of the total traffic was determined to be O-D traffic through the study corridor. This indicates that most of the traffic is from three major regions (the Kansas City metropolitan area, the City of Topeka, KS and the City of Lawrence, KS) and the estimated dynamic travel demand can be used for public transportation system planning and schedule arrangements. Due to the low location resolution using the network-based cell phone network, the use of cell phone network in collecting traffic data would be more feasible for long distance or inter-city trips. A longer observation period is also needed to increase the cell phone sample size and could be useful to obtain stable cell phone traffic, reducing the bias of the data.},

The increasing availability of empirical data enables researchers to analyze patterns of people{\textquoteright}s movements. Recent work suggested that HMP follow a Levy-flight distribution and present regularity. Here, we present an innovative agent-based model that simulates HMP for various purposes. It is based on the combination of regular movements with spatial considerations, represented by an expanded gravitation model. The agents in this model have different attributes that affect their choice of destination and the duration they stay in each location. Thus, their movement mimics real-life situations. This is a stochastic, bottom-up model, yet it yields HMP that qualitatively fit HMP empirical data in terms of individuals, as well as the entire population. Our results also correspond to real-life phenomena in terms of urban spatial dynamics, that is, the emergence of popular locations in the city due to bottom-up behavior of people. Our model is novel in being based on the assumption that HMP are space-dependent as well as follow high regularity. To our knowledge, we are the first to succeed in simulating HMP not only at the inter-city scale but also at the intra-urban one.},

	abstract = {Plant diseases heavily reduce crop yields in developing countries and tropical ecosystems. Lack of capacity to manage the diseases makes these countries particularly vulnerable to their spread. Major outbreaks can threaten national food security, displace populations and seriously damage economies that are often highly dependent on agriculture. Current predictions are that disease pressure will increase because of globalized trade and cropping practices. Climate change may also play a negative role. Strategies to combat outbreaks should ideally involve reliable monitoring, accurate detection and immediate intervention. This is particularly true for emerging diseases, which typically require rapid development and implementation of novel responses. However, developing countries often lack the capacity and infrastructure to monitor diseases fully and to implement appropriate mitigation strategies. Moreover, the discovery and reporting of new diseases can lead to trade bans that significantly harm a given country{\textquoteright}s economy. A combination is therefore required of capacity-building for disease monitoring and management together with sensible agricultural trade policies. This article describes key aspects of implementing monitoring and management in developing countries.},

	abstract = {Increasing frequency of extreme winter storms has resulted in costly damages and a disruptive impact on the northeastern United States. It is important to understand human mobility patterns during such storms for disaster preparation and relief operations. We investigated the effects of severe winter storms on human mobility during a 2015 blizzard using 2.69 million Twitter geolocations. We found that displacements of different trip distances and radii of gyration of individuals{\textquoteright} mobility were perturbed significantly. We further explored the characteristics of perturbed mobility during the storm, and demonstrated that individuals{\textquoteright} recurrent mobility does not have a higher degree of similarity with their perturbed mobility, when comparing with its similarity to non-perturbed mobility. These empirical findings on human mobility impacted by severe winter storms have potential long-term implications on emergency response planning and the development of strategies to improve resilience in severe winter storms.},

People live in different places have different socioeconomic background, resulting in various geographically activity patterns. This paper aims to label the characteristics of residential communities in a city using collective activity patterns derived from taxi trip data. Specifically, we first present a method to allocate the O/D (Origin/Destination) points of taxi trips to the land use parcels where the activities taken place in. Then several indices are employed to describe the collective activity patterns, including both activity intensity, travel distance, travel time, and activity space of residents by taking account of the geographical distribution of all O/Ds of the taxi trip related to that residential community. Followed by that, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is introduced to cluster the residential communities with similar activity patterns. In the case study of Wuhan, the residential communities are clearly divided into eight clusters, which could be labelled as ordinary communities, privileged communities, old isolated communities, suburban communities, and so on. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to label the land use under same type from people{\textquoteright}s mobility patterns with the support of big trajectory data.},

	abstract = {As an important transport tool, taxi plays a significant role to meet travel demand in urban city. Understanding the travel patterns of taxis is important for addressing many urban sustainability challenges. Previous research has primarily focused on examining the statistical properties of taxi trips to characterize travel patterns, while it may be more appropriate to explore taxi service strategies on seasonal, weekly or daily time scale. Therefore, intra-urban taxi mobility is investigated by examining taxi trajectory data that were collected in Harbin, China, while 12-week corresponding to 12-month is chosen as the sampling period in our study. The multivariate spatial point pattern analysis is firstly adopted to characterize and model the spatial dependence, and infer significant positive spatial relationships between the picked up points (PUPs) and the dropped off points (DOPs). Secondly, the points of interest (POIs) are identified from DOPs using the emerging hot spot detection technique, then the taxi services and movement patterns surrounding POIs are further examined in details. Moreover, our study builds on and extends the existing work to examine the statistical regularities of trip distances, and we also validate and quantify the impacts posed by airport trips on the distance distributions. Finally, the movement-based kernel density estimation (MKDE) method is proposed to estimate taxis' service ranges within three isopleth levels (50, 75 and 95\%) between summer/weekday and winter/weekend from taxi driver's perspective, and season as well as temperature factors are identified as the significant effect within certain service range levels. These results are expected to enhance current urban mobility research and suggest some interesting avenues for future research.},

We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'e}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling.},

	abstract = {We report that human walk patterns contain statistically similar features observed in Levy walks. These features include heavy-tail flight and pause-time distributions and the super-diffusive nature of mobility. Human walks are not random walks, but it is surprising that the patterns of human walks and Levy walks contain some statistical similarity. Our study is based on 226 daily GPS traces collected from 101 volunteers in five different outdoor sites. The heavy-tail flight distribution of human mobility induces the super-diffusivity of travel, but up to 30 min to 1 h due to the boundary effect of people's daily movement, which is caused by the tendency of people to move within a predefined (also confined) area of daily activities. These tendencies are not captured in common mobility models such as random way point (RWP). To evaluate the impact of these tendencies on the performance of mobile networks, we construct a simple truncated Levy walk mobility (TLW) model that emulates the statistical features observed in our analysis and under which we measure the performance of routing protocols in delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The results indicate the following. Higher diffusivity induces shorter intercontact times in DTN and shorter path durations with higher success probability in MANET. The diffusivity of TLW is in between those of RWP and Brownian motion (BM). Therefore, the routing performance under RWP as commonly used in mobile network studies and tends to be overestimated for DTNs and underestimated for MANETs compared to the performance under TLW.},

Here we show that current renewable energy production of Sardinia is able to sustain the commuter mobility even in the theoretical case of a full switch from internal combustion vehicles to electric ones. Centrality measures from network theory on the reconstructed network of commuter trips allows to identify the most important areas (hubs) involved in regional mobility. The analysis of the expected energy flows reveals long-range effects on infrastructures outside metropolitan areas and points out that the most relevant unbalances are caused by spatial segregation between production and consumption areas. Finally, results suggest the adoption of planning actions supporting the installation of renewable energy plants in areas mostly involved by the commuting mobility, avoiding spatial segregation between consumption and generation areas.},

An obstacle to developing effective national malaria control programs is a lack of understanding of human movements, which are an important component of disease transmission. As mobile phones have become increasingly ubiquitous, it is now possible to collect individual-level, longitudinal data on human movements on a massive scale. Wesolowski et al. (p. 267) analyzed mobile phone call data records representing the travel patterns of 15 million mobile phone owners in Kenya over the course of a year. This was combined with a detailed malaria risk map, to estimate malaria parasite movements across the country that could be caused by human movement. This information enabled detailed analysis of parasite sources and sinks between hundreds of local settlements. Estimates were compared with hospital data from Nairobi to show that local pockets of transmission likely occur around the periphery of Nairobi, accounting for locally acquired cases, contrary to the accepted idea that there is no transmission in the capital.
Human movements contribute to the transmission of malaria on spatial scales that exceed the limits of mosquito dispersal. Identifying the sources and sinks of imported infections due to human travel and locating high-risk sites of parasite importation could greatly improve malaria control programs. Here, we use spatially explicit mobile phone data and malaria prevalence information from Kenya to identify the dynamics of human carriers that drive parasite importation between regions. Our analysis identifies importation routes that contribute to malaria epidemiology on regional spatial scales.
Geographical information in mobile phone records for 15 million Kenyans is linked to malaria prevalence estimates.

Using anonymized data on mobility and calling behavior from 5.1 million Grameenphone users in Barisal Division and Chittagong District, Bangladesh, we investigate the effect of Cyclone Mahasen, which struck Barisal and Chittagong in May 2013. We characterize spatiotemporal patterns and anomalies in calling frequency, mobile recharges, and population movements before, during and after the cyclone. While it was originally anticipated that the analysis might detect mass evacuations and displacement from coastal areas in the weeks following the storm, no evidence was found to suggest any permanent changes in population distributions. We detect anomalous patterns of mobility both around the time of early warning messages and the storm{\textquoteright}s landfall, showing where and when mobility occurred as well as its characteristics. We find that anomalous patterns of mobility and calling frequency correlate with rainfall intensity (r = .75, p {\textless} 0.05) and use calling frequency to construct a spatiotemporal distribution of cyclone impact as the storm moves across the affected region. Likewise, from mobile recharge purchases we show the spatiotemporal patterns in people{\textquoteright}s preparation for the storm in vulnerable areas. In addition to demonstrating how anomaly detection can be useful for modeling human adaptation to climate extremes, we also identify several promising avenues for future improvement of disaster planning and response activities.},

	title = {Measuring patterns of human behaviour through large-scale mobile phone data - {Big} {Data} for social sciences},
	url = {https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/55139},
	abstract = {Analysis of large amounts of data, so called Big Data, is changing the way we think about science and society. One of the most promising rich Big Data sources is mobile phone data, which has the potential to deliver near real-time information of human behaviour on an individual and societal scale. Several challenges in society can be tackled in a more efficient way if such information is applied in a useful manner. Through seven publications this dissertation shows how anonymized mobile phone data can contribute to the social good and provide insights into human behaviour on a largescale. 
The size of the datasets analysed ranges from 500 million to 300 billion phone records, covering millions of people. The key contributions are two-fold: Big Data for Social Good: Through prediction algorithms the results show how mobile phone data can be useful to predict important socio-economic indicators, such as income, illiteracy and poverty in developing countries. Such knowledge can be used to identify where vulnerable groups in society are, improve allocation of resources for poverty alleviation programs, reduce economic shocks, and is a critical component for monitoring poverty rates over time. Further, the dissertation demonstrates how mobile phone data can be used to better understand human behaviour during large shocks and disasters in society, exemplified by an analysis of data from the terror attack 22nd July 2011 in Norway and a natural disaster on the south-coast in Bangladesh. This work leads to an increased understanding of how information spreads, and how millions of people move around. The intention is to identify displaced people faster, cheaper and more accurately than existing survey-based methods. 
Big Data for efficient marketing: Finally, the dissertation offers an insight into how anonymised mobile phone data can be used to map out large social networks, covering millions of people, to understand how products spread inside these networks. Results show that by including social patterns and machine learning techniques in a large-scale marketing experiment in Asia, the adoption rate is increased by 13 times compared to the approach used by experienced marketers. A data-driven and scientific approach to marketing, through more tailored campaigns, contributes to less irrelevant offers for the customers, and better cost efficiency for the companies.},

In the present work we approach this problem from another angle by leveraging additional information on Twitter customers mentioning each other, which might partially reveal their social relations. We propose a novel way of constructing a spatial social network based on such data, analyze its structure and evaluate its utility for delineating urban neighborhoods. This delineation happens to have substantial similarity to the earlier one based on the user mobility network. It leads to an assumption that the social connectivity between the users is strongly related with the similarity in their mobility patterns. We justify this hypothesis enabling extrapolation of the available user mobility patterns as a proxy for social connectivity and building a network of hidden ties based on the mobility pattern similarity. Finally, we evaluate the socio-economic characteristics of the partitions for all three networks of all mentioning, reciprocal mentioning and the hidden ties.},

	abstract = {Massive and passive data such as cell phone traces provide samples of the whereabouts and movements of individuals. These are a potential source of information for models of daily activities in a city. The main challenge is that phone traces have low spatial precision and are sparsely sampled in time, which requires a precise set of techniques for mining hidden valuable information they contain. Here we propose a method to reveal activity patterns that emerge from cell phone data by analyzing relational signatures of activity time, duration, and land use. First, we present a method of how to detect stays and extract a robust set of geolocated time stamps that represent trip chains. Second, we show how to cluster activities by combining the detected trip chains with land use data. This is accomplished by modeling the dependencies between activity type, trip scheduling, and land use types via a Relational Markov Network. We apply the method to two different kinds of mobile phone datasets from the metropolitan areas of Vienna, Austria and Boston, USA. The former data includes information from mobility management signals, while the latter are usual Call Detail Records. The resulting trip sequence patterns and activity scheduling from both datasets agree well with their respective city surveys, and we show that the inferred activity clusters are stable across different days and both cities. This method to infer activity patterns from cell phone data allows us to use these as a novel and cheaper data source for activity-based modeling and travel behavior studies.},

It is clear that both are closely related: Mobility generates encounters, and these encounters might give rise to contagion phenomena or even friendship. We model a set of random walkers that visit locations in space following a strategy akin to L{\'e}vy flights. We measure the encounters in space and time and establish a link between walkers after they coincide several times. This generates a temporal network that is characterized by global quantities. We compare this dynamics with real data for two cities: New York City and Tokyo. We use data from the location-based social network Foursquare and obtain the emergent temporal encounter network, for these two cities, that we compare with our model. We found long-range (L{\'e}vy-like) distributions for traveled distances and time intervals that characterize the emergent social network due to human mobility. Studying this connection is important for several fields like epidemics, social influence, voting, contagion models, behavioral adoption and diffusion of ideas.},

Further, we proposed a model which may explain the mechanism for the power-law distribution: mobility distance is constrained by time and fare. Specifically, the relationship between fare and mobility distance follows piecewise function, and responds to individual sensitivity; the relationship between time and mobility distance follows significant logarithmic relationship. These two factors, especially the logarithmic relationship between time and mobility distance, may contribute to a power-law distribution instead of an exponential one. Finally, with a simulation model, we verify the significant power-law distribution of human mobility behavioral distance with a single vehicle, by supplementing factors of waiting time and fare.},

We validate the performance and generalizability of our approach using two ground-truth datasets on air travel and daily commuting in the United States: using two different cross-validation schemes we show that the hybrid model affords enhanced mobility prediction at both spatial scales.},

The analysis is based on three large taxi GPS datasets in Rome, San Francisco and Beijing containing 21 million, 11 million and 17 million GPS points respectively. We categorized the city regions into four kinds of places, workplaces, entertainment places, residential places and other places. First, we provide a new quad-tree region division method based on the taxi visits. Second, we use the association rule to infer the functional regions in these three cities according to temporal human mobility patterns. Third, we show that these identified functional regions can help us deliver data in network applications, such as urban Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), more efficiently. The new functional-regions-based DTNs algorithm achieves up to 183\% improvement in terms of delivery ratio.},

Taking taxi as mobile sensors, the information derived from taxi trips benefits the city and transportation planning. The original data used in study are collected from more than 1100 taxi drivers in Harbin city. We firstly divide the city area into 400 different transportation districts and analyze the origin and destination distribution in urban area on weekday and weekend. The Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is used to cluster pick-up and drop-off locations. Furthermore, four spatial interaction models are calibrated and compared based on trajectories in shopping center of Harbin city to study the pick-up location searching behavior. By extracting taxi trips from GPS data, travel distance, time and average speed in occupied and non-occupied status are then used to investigate human mobility. Finally, we use observed OD matrix of center area in Harbin city to model the traffic distribution patterns based on entropy-maximizing method, and the estimation performance verify its effectiveness in case study.},

This article analyses geo-located Twitter messages in order to uncover global patterns of human mobility. Based on a dataset of almost a billion tweets recorded in 2012, we estimate the volume of international travelers by country of residence. Mobility profiles of different nations were examined based on such characteristics as mobility rate, radius of gyration, diversity of destinations, and inflow{\textendash}outflow balance. Temporal patterns disclose the universally valid seasons of increased international mobility and the particular character of international travels of different nations. Our analysis of the community structure of the Twitter mobility network reveals spatially cohesive regions that follow the regional division of the world. We validate our result using global tourism statistics and mobility models provided by other authors and argue that Twitter is exceptionally useful for understanding and quantifying global mobility patterns.},

	abstract = {Intra-urban human mobility is investigated by means of taxi trajectory data that are collected in Shanghai, China, where taxis play an important role in urban transportation. From the taxi trajectories, approximately 1.5 million trips of anonymous customers are extracted on seven consecutive days. The globally spatio-temporal patterns of trips exhibit a significant daily regularity. Since each trip can be viewed as a displacement in the random walk model, the distributions of the distance and direction of the extracted trips are investigated in this research. The direction distribution shows an NEE{\textendash}SWW-dominant direction, and the distance distribution can be well fitted by an exponentially truncated power law, with the scaling exponent $\beta$ = 1.2 {\textpm} 0.15. The observed patterns are attributed to the geographical heterogeneity of the study area, which makes the spatial distribution of trajectory stops to be non-uniform. We thus construct a model that integrates both the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect, to interpret the observed patterns. Our Monte Carlo simulation results closely match to the observed patterns and thus validate the proposed model. According to the proposed model, in a single-core urban area, the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect improve each other when influencing human mobility patterns. Geographical heterogeneity leads to a faster observed decay, and the distance decay effect makes the spatial distribution of trips more concentrated.},

In this paper, we build models for 20 million trajectories with fine granularity collected from more than 10 thousand taxis in Beijing. In contrast to most models observed in human mobility data, the taxis{\textquoteright} traveling displacements in urban areas tend to follow an exponential distribution instead of a power-law. Similarly, the elapsed time can also be well approximated by an exponential distribution. Worth mentioning, analysis of the interevent time indicates the bursty nature of human mobility, similar to many other human activities.},

Most efforts on studying human mobility have so far used private and low resolution data, such as call data records.

We analyse a Twitter dataset with more than six million geotagged tweets posted in Australia, and we demonstrate that Twitter can be a reliable source for studying human mobility patterns. Our analysis shows that geotagged tweets can capture rich features of human mobility, such as the diversity of movement orbits among individuals and of movements within and between cities. We also find that short- and long-distance movers both spend most of their time in large metropolitan areas, in contrast with intermediate-distance movers{\textquoteright} movements, reflecting the impact of different modes of travel. Our study provides solid evidence that Twitter can indeed be a useful proxy for tracking and predicting human movement.},

Many researchers have assumed that these distributions are exponential, but our results based on empirical analysis show that dwell time and sign-on interarrival time can be accurately described using heavy-tailed arithmetic distributions that have infinite mean and variance. We also show that the number of handoffs per sign-on can be modeled accurately with a heavy-tailed distribution.},

Developing regions, such as the Ivory Coast, are marked by a number of factors that may influence mobility, such as less infrastructural coverage and maturity, less economic resources and stability, and in some cases, more cultural and language-based diversity. By comparing mobile phone data collected from the Ivory Coast to similar data collected in Portugal, we are able to highlight both qualitative and quantitative differences in mobility patterns - such as differences in likelihood to travel, as well as in the time required to travel - that are relevant to consideration on policy, infrastructure, and economic development. Our study illustrates how cultural and linguistic diversity in developing regions (such as Ivory Coast) can present challenges to mobility models that perform well and were conceptualized in less culturally diverse regions. Finally, we address these challenges by proposing novel techniques to assess the strength of borders in a regional partitioning scheme and to quantify the impact of border strength on mobility model accuracy.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the striking proliferation of Big Data and the new scientific tools provided by the emerging field of Data Science finally pave the road to realize a longstanding dream of scientists and policy makers: drawing a comprehensive picture of human social behavior. Big Data, indeed, hide a huge amount of predictive power, which can be exploited by governments and companies to unveiling and understanding the complexity underlying our society.
In the present thesis we propose a multidimensional study of human social behavior, aimed to understand how the social network, the mobility behavior and the economic wellness of people in a big European country are connected to each other. To this end we exploit the access to a big mobile phone dataset provided by the French telecom provider Orange. Thanks to Big Data management tools like Hadoop, we computed several individual measures, each describing different aspects of the social or mobility behavior of individuals and their aggregation at various geographic scales. Our analysis confirmed the existence of known patterns and revealed new interesting ones.
Firstly, the observation at neighborhood level of the three biggest cities in France (Paris, Marseille, Lyon) uncovers a very strong correlation between the social diversification and the mobile predictability. People who equally diversify their calls over the social contacts tend to have a more erratic mobile behavior.
Moreover, an even more interesting relationships emerged between the mobile behavior and the economic status: mobility diversity is strongly correlated with some indexes of economic wellness. These striking results leaves no room for doubt: the greater the diversification of the mobile behavior of people within a territory, the higher their economic prosperity.
Such findings open interesting future perspective about the study of human social behavior. New statistical indexes can be defined which rely on mobile phone data to describe and predict (nowcast) the actual and future economic health of a territory},

Experimental studies have verified this property in real social networks, and theoretical models have been advanced to explain it. However, existing theoretical models have not been shown to capture behavior in real-world social networks. Here, we introduce a richer model relating geography and social-network friendship, in which the probability of befriending a particular person is inversely proportional to the number of closer people. In a large social network, we show that one-third of the friendships are independent of geography and the remainder exhibit the proposed relationship. Further, we prove analytically that short chains can be discovered in every network exhibiting the relationship.},

It is important for urban and transportation planners to be able to use data containing valuable location information that is not easily obtainable from traditional datasets, such as expensive household surveys, extensive traffic counts, or aggregated socioeconomic statistics. This study explored the potential of using mobile phone data to characterize and compare urban activity and mobility patterns from daily and hourly mobile phone records across 10 cities in Korea. We compared the internal and external mobility of phone users, and calculated urban attractiveness and home-based trip length frequency distribution for comparisons of different sized cities. The spatiotemporal evolution of urban activity within a day was examined, and the spatiotemporal extension for each city was calculated, showing the degree of spatial dispersion of residences and other activity locations. We also identified urban activity subcenters and hotspots based on density and time persistence criteria, as well as their compactness. Policy makers can expect to see more applications using mobile phone data, and this study helps demonstrate the potential of such data. We hope that spatiotemporal activity analysis can provide a foundation for future research that will help improve urban and transportation policies.},

This study addressed a gap in literature by investigating the correlation between demand for taxi, land use patterns, and accessibility to other modes using detailed GPS and GIS information collected from the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. The results of the models showed a strong link between demand for taxi, land use patterns, and accessibility to other modes. Mixed land use did not show a strong correlation with taxi demand. The study also found that the taxi mode is likely to complement metro trips, but compete with bus trips, although both of these modes of travel are considered public transit. Airport trips were found to be the most important source for taxi travel. These findings were further supported by the time-of-day and seasonality analysis.},

Subsequent investigation demonstrated that the entropy maximising method stems from an even higher level of generality, and the beginning of the book is devoted to an account of its importance and use as a general modelling tool.This reissue will be welcomed by a range of students and professionals from fields as diverse as urban and regional studies, economics, geography, planning, civil engineering, mathematics and statistics.},

	abstract = {Social systems are in a constant state of flux, with dynamics spanning from minute-by-minute changes to patterns present on the timescale of years. Accurate models of social dynamics are important for understanding the spreading of influence or diseases, formation of friendships, and the productivity of teams. Although there has been much progress on understanding complex networks over the past decade, little is known about the regularities governing the microdynamics of social networks. Here, we explore the dynamic social network of a densely-connected population of \~{}1,000 individuals and their interactions in the network of real-world person-to-person proximity measured via Bluetooth, as well as their telecommunication networks, online social media contacts, geolocation, and demographic data. These high-resolution data allow us to observe social groups directly, rendering community detection unnecessary. Starting from 5-min time slices, we uncover dynamic social structures expressed on multiple timescales. On the hourly timescale, we find that gatherings are fluid, with members coming and going, but organized via a stable core of individuals. Each core represents a social context. Cores exhibit a pattern of recurring meetings across weeks and months, each with varying degrees of regularity. Taken together, these findings provide a powerful simplification of the social network, where cores represent fundamental structures expressed with strong temporal and spatial regularity. Using this framework, we explore the complex interplay between social and geospatial behavior, documenting how the formation of cores is preceded by coordination behavior in the communication networks and demonstrating that social behavior can be predicted with high precision.},

We present an overview of empirical results on the multi-scale dynamics of social dynamics and networks inferred from mobile telephone calls. We begin with the shortest timescales and fastest dynamics, such as burstiness of call sequences between individuals, and "zoom out" towards longer temporal and larger structural scales, from temporal motifs formed by correlated calls between multiple individuals to long-term dynamics of social groups.

	abstract = {Human movement plays a key role in economies and development, the delivery of services, and the spread of infectious diseases. However, it remains poorly quantified partly because reliable data are often lacking, particularly for low-income countries. The most widely available are migration data from human population censuses, which provide valuable information on relatively long timescale relocations across countries, but do not capture the shorter-scale patterns, trips less than a year, that make up the bulk of human movement. Census-derived migration data may provide valuable proxies for shorter-term movements however, as substantial migration between regions can be indicative of well connected places exhibiting high levels of movement at finer time scales, but this has never been examined in detail. Here, an extensive mobile phone usage data set for Kenya was processed to extract movements between counties in 2009 on weekly, monthly, and annual time scales and compared to data on change in residence from the national census conducted during the same time period. We find that the relative ordering across Kenyan counties for incoming, outgoing and between-county movements shows strong correlations. Moreover, the distributions of trip durations from both sources of data are similar, and a spatial interaction model fit to the data reveals the relationships of different parameters over a range of movement time scales. Significant relationships between census migration data and fine temporal scale movement patterns exist, and results suggest that census data can be used to approximate certain features of movement patterns across multiple temporal scales, extending the utility of census-derived migration data.},

The reach, volume and speed of modern travel are unprecedented, with human mobility increasing in high income countries by over 1000-fold since 1800. This growth is putting people at risk from the emergence of new strains of familiar diseases, and from completely new diseases, while ever more cases of the movement of both disease vectors and the diseases they carry are being seen. Pathogens and their vectors can now move further, faster and in greater numbers than ever before. Equally however, we now have access to the most detailed and comprehensive datasets on human mobility and pathogen distributions ever assembled, in order to combat these threats. This short review paper provides an overview of these datasets, with a particular focus on low income regions, and covers briefly approaches used to combine them to help us understand and control some of the negative effects of population and pathogen movements.},

We aimed to test whether mobile operator data could predict the early spatial evolution of the 2010 Haiti cholera epidemic. Daily case data were analysed for 78 study areas from October 16 to December 16, 2010. Movements of 2.9 million anonymous mobile phone SIM cards were used to create a national mobility network. Two gravity models of population mobility were implemented for comparison. Both were optimized based on the complete retrospective epidemic data, available only after the end of the epidemic spread. Risk of an area experiencing an outbreak within seven days showed strong dose-response relationship with the mobile phone-based infectious pressure estimates. The mobile phone-based model performed better (AUC 0.79) than the retrospectively optimized gravity models (AUC 0.66 and 0.74, respectively). Infectious pressure at outbreak onset was significantly correlated with reported cholera cases during the first ten days of the epidemic (p {\textless} 0.05). Mobile operator data is a highly promising data source for improving preparedness and response efforts during cholera outbreaks. Findings may be particularly important for containment efforts of emerging infectious diseases, including high-mortality influenza strains.},

	doi = {10.1126/science.1251722},
	abstract = {Existing research on the extensive Chinese censorship organization uses observational methods with well-known limitations. We conducted the first large-scale experimental study of censorship by creating accounts on numerous social media sites, randomly submitting different texts, and observing from a worldwide network of computers which texts were censored and which were not. We also supplemented interviews with confidential sources by creating our own social media site, contracting with Chinese firms to install the same censoring technologies as existing sites, and{\textemdash}with their software, documentation, and even customer support{\textemdash}reverse-engineering how it all works. Our results offer rigorous support for the recent hypothesis that criticisms of the state, its leaders, and their policies are published, whereas posts about real-world events with collective action potential are censored.
Introduction Censorship has a long history in China, extending from the efforts of Emperor Qin to burn Confucian texts in the third century BCE to the control of traditional broadcast media under Communist Party rule. However, with the rise of the Internet and new media platforms, more than 1.3 billion people can now broadcast their individual views, making information far more diffuse and considerably harder to control. In response, the government has built a massive social media censorship organization, the result of which constitutes the largest selective suppression of human communication in the recorded history of any country. We show that this large system, designed to suppress information, paradoxically leaves large footprints and so reveals a great deal about itself and the intentions of the government.
The Chinese censorship decision tree. The pictures shown are examples of real (and typical) websites, along with our translations.
Rationale Chinese censorship of individual social media posts occurs at two levels: (i) Many tens of thousands of censors, working inside Chinese social media firms and government at several levels, read individual social media posts, and decide which ones to take down. (ii) They also read social media submissions that are prevented from being posted by automated keyword filters, and decide which ones to publish. To study the first level, we devised an observational study to download published Chinese social media posts before the government could censor them, and to revisit each from a worldwide network of computers to see which was censored. To study the second level, we conducted the first largescale experimental study of censorship by creating accounts on numerous social media sites throughout China, submitting texts with different randomly assigned content to each, and detecting from a worldwide network of computers which ones were censored. To find out the details of how the system works, we supplemented the typical current approach (conducting uncertain and potentially unsafe confidential interviews with insiders) with a participant observation study, in which we set up our own social media site in China. While also attempting not to alter the system we were studying, we purchased a URL, rented server space, contracted with Chinese firms to acquire the same software as used by existing social media sites, and{\textemdash}with direct access to their software, documentation, and even customer service help desk support{\textemdash}reverseengineered how it all works.
Results Criticisms of the state, its leaders, and their policies are routinely published, whereas posts with collective action potential are much more likely to be censored{\textemdash}regardless of whether they are for or against the state (two concepts not previously distinguished in the literature). Chinese people can write the most vitriolic blog posts about even the top Chinese leaders without fear of censorship, but if they write in support of or opposition to an ongoing protest{\textemdash}or even about a rally in favor of a popular policy or leader{\textemdash}they will be censored. We clarify the internal mechanisms of the Chinese censorship apparatus and show how changes in censorship behavior reveal government intent by presaging their action on the ground. That is, it appears that criticism on the web, which was thought to be censored, is used by Chinese leaders to determine which officials are not doing their job of mollifying the people and need to be replaced.
Conclusion Censorship in China is used to muzzle those outside government who attempt to spur the creation of crowds for any reason{\textemdash}in opposition to, in support of, or unrelated to the government. The government allows the Chinese people to say whatever they like about the state, its leaders, or their policies, because talk about any subject unconnected to collective action is not censored. The value that Chinese leaders find in allowing and then measuring criticism by hundreds of millions of Chinese people creates actionable information for them and, as a result, also for academic scholars and public policy analysts.
Censorship of social media in China
Figuring out how many and which social media comments are censored by governments is difficult because those comments, by definition, cannot be read. King et al. have posted comments to social media sites in China and then waited to see which of these never appeared, which appeared and were then removed, and which appeared and survived. About 40\% of their submissions were reviewed by an army of censors, and more than half of these never appeared. By varying the content of posts across topics, they conclude that any mention of collective action is selectively suppressed.

Because by definition all physical activities lead to energy expenditure, the doubly labelled water (DLW) method as gold standard to assess total energy expenditure over longer periods of time is the method of choice to validate accelerometers in their ability to assess daily physical activities. The aim of this paper was to provide a systematic overview of all recent (2007-2011) accelerometer validation studies using DLW as the reference. The PubMed Central database was searched using the following keywords: doubly or double labelled or labeled water in combination with accelerometer, accelerometry, motion sensor, or activity monitor. Limits were set to include articles from 2007 to 2011, as earlier publications were covered in a previous review. In total, 38 articles were identified, of which 25 were selected to contain sufficient new data. Eighteen different accelerometers were validated. There was a large variability in accelerometer output and their validity to assess daily physical activity. Activity type recognition has great potential to improve the assessment of physical activity-related health outcomes. So far, there is little evidence that adding other physiological measures such as heart rate significantly improves the estimation of energy expenditure.},

This representation has been used by various researchers to support clustering, classification, indexing and association rule mining of time series data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation, with several algorithms having been independently rediscovered several times. In this paper, we undertake the first extensive review and empirical comparison of all proposed techniques. We show that all these algorithms have fatal flaws from a data mining perspective.

	abstract = {In this study we estimate urban traffic flow using GPS-enabled taxi trajectory data in Qingdao, China, and examine the capability of the betweenness centrality of the street network to predict traffic flow. The results show that betweenness centrality is not a good predictor variable for urban traffic flow, which has, theoretically, been pointed out in existing literature. With a critique of the betweenness centrality as a predictor, we further analyze the characteristics of betweenness centrality and point out the {\textquoteleft}gap{\textquoteright} between this centrality measure and actual flow. Rather than considering only the topological properties of a street network, we take into account two aspects, the spatial heterogeneity of human activities and the distance-decay law, to explain the observed traffic-flow distribution. The spatial distribution of human activities is estimated using mobile phone Erlang values, and the power law distance decay is adopted. We run Monte Carlo simulations to generate trips and predict traffic-flow distributions, and use a weighted correlation coefficient to measure the goodness of fit between the observed and the simulated data. The correlation coefficient achieves the maximum (0.623) when the exponent equals 2.0, indicating that the proposed model, which incorporates geographical constraints and human mobility patterns, can interpret urban traffic flow well.

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes.},

	abstract = {Taxi services are a vital part of urban transportation, and a considerable contributor to traffic congestion and air pollution causing substantial adverse effects on human health. Sharing taxi trips is a possible way of reducing the negative impact of taxi services on cities, but this comes at the expense of passenger discomfort quantifiable in terms of a longer travel time. Due to computational challenges, taxi sharing has traditionally been approached on small scales, such as within airport perimeters, or with dynamical ad hoc heuristics. However, a mathematical framework for the systematic understanding of the tradeoff between collective benefits of sharing and individual passenger discomfort is lacking. Here we introduce the notion of shareability network, which allows us to model the collective benefits of sharing as a function of passenger inconvenience, and to efficiently compute optimal sharing strategies on massive datasets. We apply this framework to a dataset of millions of taxi trips taken in New York City, showing that with increasing but still relatively low passenger discomfort, cumulative trip length can be cut by 40\% or more. This benefit comes with reductions in service cost, emissions, and with split fares, hinting toward a wide passenger acceptance of such a shared service. Simulation of a realistic online system demonstrates the feasibility of a shareable taxi service in New York City. Shareability as a function of trip density saturates fast, suggesting effectiveness of the taxi sharing system also in cities with much sparser taxi fleets or when willingness to share is low.},

	abstract = {As the number of smartphone users has grown recently, many context-aware services have been studied and launched. Activity recognition becomes one of the important issues for user adaptive services on the mobile phones. Even though many researchers have attempted to recognize a user's activities on a mobile device, it is still difficult to infer human activities from uncertain, incomplete and insufficient mobile sensor data. We present a method to recognize a person's activities from sensors in a mobile phone using mixture-of-experts (ME) model. In order to train the ME model, we have applied global{\textendash}local co-training (GLCT) algorithm with both labeled and unlabeled data to improve the performance. The GLCT is a variation of co-training that uses a global model and a local model together. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments using real datasets collected from Google Android smartphones. This paper is a revised and extended version of a paper that was presented at HAIS 2011.},

	abstract = {Although human activity recognition (HAR) has been studied extensively in the past decade, HAR on smartphones is a relatively new area. Smartphones are equipped with a variety of sensors. Fusing the data of these sensors could enable applications to recognize a large number of activities. Realizing this goal is challenging, however. Firstly, these devices are low on resources, which limits the number of sensors that can be utilized. Secondly, to achieve optimum performance efficient feature extraction, feature selection and classification methods are required. This work implements a smartphone-based HAR scheme in accordance with these requirements. Time domain features are extracted from only three smartphone sensors, and a nonlinear discriminatory approach is employed to recognize 15 activities with a high accuracy. This approach not only selects the most relevant features from each sensor for each activity but it also takes into account the differences resulting from carrying a phone at different positions. Evaluations are performed in both offline and online settings. Our comparison results show that the proposed system outperforms some previous mobile phone-based HAR systems.},

	abstract = {Human activity-travel behaviour (ATB) is a complex pattern of paths and activities in space and time. Studies indicate that ATB is the construction of daily habitual, weekly, monthly and seasonal routines together with strong variety seeking behaviour. Daily habitual travel patterns are usually taken as a basis, but for transportation planners more knowledge is needed on longitudinal trends in human ATB. Empirical data on prolonged perspective are hard to come by while mobile phone based call detail records could be one means of narrowing this research gap. By implementing this method, the present study attempts to provide new insights on individual monthly spatial travel behaviour. Using call detail records obtained from a set of anonymous mobile phone users, we examined their activity locations and activity spaces for 12 consecutive months. We found modest monthly variation in the number of activity locations, whereas there were great variations in the sizes of individual activity spaces. The monthly variation in individual spatial behaviour is explained up to 17\% by seasonality, although the variance is predominantly attributed to individual factors and results indicate significant intrapersonal monthly variability. Findings suggest new avenues for future work on ATB from a longitudinal perspective. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, a considerable global need exists for portable, rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective detection techniques that can be used in resource-limited and field settings. Here we introduce a smart-phone-based hand-held platform that allows the quantification of mercury(II) ions in water samples with parts per billion (ppb) level of sensitivity. For this task, we created an integrated opto-mechanical attachment to the built-in camera module of a smart-phone to digitally quantify mercury concentration using a plasmonic gold nanoparticle (Au NP) and aptamer based colorimetric transmission assay that is implemented in disposable test tubes. With this smart-phone attachment that weighs {\textless}40 g, we quantified mercury(II) ion concentration in water samples by using a two-color ratiometric method employing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) at 523 and 625 nm, where a custom-developed smart application was utilized to process each acquired transmission image on the same phone to achieve a limit of detection of ?3.5 ppb. Using this smart-phone-based detection platform, we generated a mercury contamination map by measuring water samples at over 50 locations in California (USA), taken from city tap water sources, rivers, lakes, and beaches. With its cost-effective design, field-portability, and wireless data connectivity, this sensitive and specific heavy metal detection platform running on cellphones could be rather useful for distributed sensing, tracking, and sharing of water contamination information as a function of both space and time.},

	abstract = {Background Rapid developments in technology have encouraged the use of smartphones in physical activity research, although little is known regarding their effectiveness as measurement and intervention tools. Objective This study systematically reviewed evidence on smartphones and their viability for measuring and influencing physical activity. Data Sources Research articles were identified in September 2013 by literature searches in Web of Knowledge, PubMed, PsycINFO, EBSCO, and ScienceDirect. Study Selection The search was restricted using the terms (physical activity OR exercise OR fitness) AND (smartphone* OR mobile phone* OR cell phone*) AND (measurement OR intervention). Reviewed articles were required to be published in international academic peer-reviewed journals, or in full text from international scientific conferences, and focused on measuring physical activity through smartphone processing data and influencing people to be more active through smartphone applications. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods Two reviewers independently performed the selection of articles and examined titles and abstracts to exclude those out of scope. Data on study characteristics, technologies used to objectively measure physical activity, strategies applied to influence activity; and the main study findings were extracted and reported. Results A total of 26 articles (with the first published in 2007) met inclusion criteria. All studies were conducted in highly economically advantaged countries; 12 articles focused on special populations (e.g. obese patients). Studies measured physical activity using native mobile features, and/or an external device linked to an application. Measurement accuracy ranged from 52 to 100 \% (n = 10 studies). A total of 17 articles implemented and evaluated an intervention. Smartphone strategies to influence physical activity tended to be ad hoc, rather than theory-based approaches; physical activity profiles, goal setting, real-time feedback, social support networking, and online expert consultation were identified as the most useful strategies to encourage physical activity change. Only five studies assessed physical activity intervention effects; all used step counts as the outcome measure. Four studies (three pre{\textendash}post and one comparative) reported physical activity increases (12{\textendash}42 participants, 800{\textendash}1,104 steps/day, 2 weeks{\textendash}6 months), and one case-control study reported physical activity maintenance (n = 200 participants; {\textgreater}10,000 steps/day) over 3 months. Limitations Smartphone use is a relatively new field of study in physical activity research, and consequently the evidence base is emerging. Conclusions Few studies identified in this review considered the validity of phone-based assessment of physical activity. Those that did report on measurement properties found average-to-excellent levels of accuracy for different behaviors. The range of novel and engaging intervention strategies used by smartphones, and user perceptions on their usefulness and viability, highlights the potential such technology has for physical activity promotion. However, intervention effects reported in the extant literature are modest at best, and future studies need to utilize randomized controlled trial research designs, larger sample sizes, and longer study periods to better explore the physical activity measurement and intervention capabilities of smartphones.},

	abstract = {Signal segmentation is a crucial stage in the activity recognition process; however, this has been rarely and vaguely characterized so far. Windowing approaches are normally used for segmentation, but no clear consensus exists on which window size should be preferably employed. In fact, most designs normally rely on figures used in previous works, but with no strict studies that support them. Intuitively, decreasing the window size allows for a faster activity detection, as well as reduced resources and energy needs. On the contrary, large data windows are normally considered for the recognition of complex activities. In this work, we present an extensive study to fairly characterize the windowing procedure, to determine its impact within the activity recognition process and to help clarify some of the habitual assumptions made during the recognition system design. To that end, some of the most widely used activity recognition procedures are evaluated for a wide range of window sizes and activities. From the evaluation, the interval 1{\textendash}2 s proves to provide the best trade-off between recognition speed and accuracy. The study, specifically intended for on-body activity recognition systems, further provides designers with a set of guidelines devised to facilitate the system definition and configuration according to the particular application requirements and target activities.},

	abstract = {User mobility has given rise to a variety of Web applications, in which the global positioning system (GPS) plays many important roles in bridging between these applications and end users. As a kind of human behavior, transportation modes, such as walking and driving, can provide pervasive computing systems with more contextual information and enrich a user's mobility with informative knowledge. In this article, we report on an approach based on supervised learning to automatically infer users' transportation modes, including driving, walking, taking a bus and riding a bike, from raw GPS logs. Our approach consists of three parts: a change point-based segmentation method, an inference model and a graph-based post-processing algorithm. First, we propose a change point-based segmentation method to partition each GPS trajectory into separate segments of different transportation modes. Second, from each segment, we identify a set of sophisticated features, which are not affected by differing traffic conditions (e.g., a person's direction when in a car is constrained more by the road than any change in traffic conditions). Later, these features are fed to a generative inference model to classify the segments of different modes. Third, we conduct graph-based postprocessing to further improve the inference performance. This postprocessing algorithm considers both the commonsense constraints of the real world and typical user behaviors based on locations in a probabilistic manner. The advantages of our method over the related works include three aspects. (1) Our approach can effectively segment trajectories containing multiple transportation modes. (2) Our work mined the location constraints from user-generated GPS logs, while being independent of additional sensor data and map information like road networks and bus stops. (3) The model learned from the dataset of some users can be applied to infer GPS data from others. Using the GPS logs collected by 65 people over a period of 10 months, we evaluated our approach via a set of experiments. As a result, based on the change-point-based segmentation method and Decision Tree-based inference model, we achieved prediction accuracy greater than 71 percent. Further, using the graph-based post-processing algorithm, the performance attained a 4-percent enhancement.},

Most existing studies focus on building ad-hoc querying, analysis, as well as data mining techniques on formed trajectories. As a prior step, trajectory construction is evidently necessary for mobility data processing and understanding, including tasks like trajectory data cleaning, compression, and segmentation so as to identify semantic trajectory episodes like stops (e.g. while sitting and standing) and moves (while jogging, walking, driving etc). However, semantic trajectory construction methods in the current literature are typically based on offline procedures, which is not sufficient for real life trajectory applications that rely on timely delivery of computed trajectories to serve real-time query answers. Filling this gap, our paper proposes a platform, namely SeTraStream, for online semantic trajectory construction. Our framework is capable of providing real-time trajectory data cleaning, compression, segmentation over streaming movement data.},

We review the history and current state of visualization in sociology. Using examples throughout, we discuss recent developments in ways of seeing raw data and presenting the results of statistical modeling. We make a general distinction between those methods and tools designed to help explore data sets and those designed to help present results to others. We argue that recent advances should be seen as part of a broader shift toward easier sharing of code and data both between researchers and with wider publics, and we encourage practitioners and publishers to work toward a higher and more consistent standard for the graphical display of sociological insights.},

Typically such mobility data analytics is assumed to follow the model of a stream of (x,y,t) points, usually coming from GPS-enabled mobile devices. With large-scale adoption of GPS-driven systems in several application sectors (shipment tracking to geo-social networks), there is a growing demand from applications to understand the spatio-semantic behavior of mobile entities. Spatio-semantic behavior essentially means a semantic (and preferably contextual) abstraction of raw spatio-temporal location feeds. The core contribution of this paper lies in presenting a Hybrid Model and a Computing Platform for developing a semantic overlay - analyzing and transforming raw mobility data (GPS) to meaningful semantic abstractions, starting from raw feeds to semantic trajectories. Secondly, we analyze large-scale GPS data using our computing platform and present results of extracted spatio-semantic trajectories. This impacts a large class of mobile applications requiring such semantic abstractions over streaming location feeds in real systems today.},

Tasks such as the prediction of human movement can be addressed through the usage of these data, in turn offering support for more advanced applications, such as adaptive mobile services with proactive context-based functions. This paper addresses the problem of predicting human mobility on the basis of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), an approach that allows us to account with location characteristics as unobservable parameters, and also to account with the effects of each individual's previous actions. We report on a series of experiments with both regular and second-order HMMs. The experiments were made with a real-world location history dataset from the LifeMap project, and the results show that a high prediction accuracy, relative to the dificulty of the task, can be achieved when considering relatively small regions.},

This multi-dimensional source of data offers new possibilities to tackle established research problems on human mobility, but it also opens avenues for the development of novel mobile applications and services. In this work we study the problem of predicting the next venue a mobile user will visit, by exploring the predictive power offered by different facets of user behavior. We first analyze about 35 million check-ins made by about 1 million Foursquare users in over 5 million venues across the globe, spanning a period of five months. We then propose a set of features that aim to capture the factors that may drive users' movements. Our features exploit information on transitions between types of places, mobility flows between venues, and spatio-temporal characteristics of user check-in patterns. We further extend our study combining all individual features in two supervised learning models, based on linear regression and M5 model trees, resulting in a higher overall prediction accuracy. We find that the supervised methodology based on the combination of multiple features offers the highest levels of prediction accuracy: M5 model trees are able to rank in the top fifty venues one in two user check-ins, amongst thousands of candidate items in the prediction list.},

In this work, rather than determining the next location of a person, we focus on the predicting the location of a person when it changes. We employed a two phase method; which first clusters the data to obtain a higher granularity level, and then extracts frequent sequential patterns corresponding to location changes. We have validated our results with real data obtained from one of the largest mobile phone operators in Turkey. Our results are very encouraging, and we have obtained very high accuracy results in predicting the change of location of mobile phone users.},

Traditional approaches like online time series segmentation either use a fixed model or only apply an adaptive model on one dimensional data; it turns out that such methods are not very applicable to build online segmentation for multiple dimensional mobile sensor data (e.g., 3D accelerometer or 11 dimension features like 'mean', 'variance', 'covariance', 'magnitude', etc). In this paper, we design an adaptive model for segmenting real-time accelerometer data from smartphones, which is able to (a) dynamically select suitable dimensions to build a model, and (b) adaptively pick up a proper model. In addition to using the traditional residual-style regression errors to evaluate time series segmentation, we design a rich metric to evaluate mobile data segmentation results, including (1) traditional regression error, (2) information retrieval style measurements (i.e., precision, recall, F-measure), and (3) segmentation time delay.},

	abstract = {Longitudinal behavioral data generally contains a significant amount of structure. In this work, we identify the structure inherent in daily behavior with models that can accurately analyze, predict, and cluster multimodal data from individuals and communities within the social network of a population. We represent this behavioral structure by the principal components of the complete behavioral dataset, a set of characteristic vectors we have termed eigenbehaviors. In our model, an individual{\textquoteright}s behavior over a specific day can be approximated by a weighted sum of his or her primary eigenbehaviors. When these weights are calculated halfway through a day, they can be used to predict the day{\textquoteright}s remaining behaviors with 79\% accuracy for our test subjects. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for this dimensionality reduction technique to infer community affiliations within the subjects{\textquoteright} social network by clustering individuals into a {\textquotedblleft}behavior space{\textquotedblright} spanned by a set of their aggregate eigenbehaviors. These behavior spaces make it possible to determine the behavioral similarity between both individuals and groups, enabling 96\% classification accuracy of community affiliations within the population-level social network. Additionally, the distance between individuals in the behavior space can be used as an estimate for relational ties such as friendship, suggesting strong behavioral homophily amongst the subjects. This approach capitalizes on the large amount of rich data previously captured during the Reality Mining study from mobile phones continuously logging location, proximate phones, and communication of 100 subjects at MIT over the course of 9 months. As wearable sensors continue to generate these types of rich, longitudinal datasets, dimensionality reduction techniques such as eigenbehaviors will play an increasingly important role in behavioral research.},

For this purpose, mobile phones with Global Positioning System technology have been used to collect daily trajectories of the individuals with higher temporal resolution and a trajectory data mining, and geo-spatial analysis algorithm was developed and implemented within a Geographical Information System to obtain time{\textendash}activity patterns. These data were combined with air pollutant concentrations estimated for several microenvironments. In addition to outdoor, pollutant concentrations in distinct indoor microenvironments are characterised using a probabilistic approach. An example of the application for PM2.5 is presented and discussed.

Results indicate that the highest QoL neighbourhoods were most stable, while those with lower homeownership, closer to the city centre, exhibited the sharpest longitudinal trajectories. Lower-income neighbourhoods are found to be heterogeneous in terms of their social problems, dividing between high crime concentrations and youth-related social problems.

Co-locations appear indicative of coordination calls, which occur just before face-to-face meetings.

	abstract = {Today, large-volume mobile phone call datasets are widely applied to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of human urban activity. This paper discusses several fundamental issues in estimating population distributions based on mobile call data. By adopting an individual-based call activity dataset that consists of nearly two million mobile subscribers who made over one hundred million communications over seven consecutive days, we explore the relationships among the Erlang values, the number of calls, and the number of active mobile subscribers. Then, the LandScan population density dataset is introduced to evaluate the process of estimating the population. The empirical findings indicate that: (1) Temporal variation exists in the relation between the Erlang values and the number of calls; (2) The number of calls is linearly proportional to the number of active mobile subscribers; (3) The proportion between the mobile subscribers and the actual total population varies in different areas, thus failing to represent the underlying population. Hence, the call activity reflects {\textquotedblleft}activity intensity{\textquotedblright} rather than population distribution. The Erlang is a defective indicator of population distribution, whereas the number of calls serves as a better measure. This research provides an explicit clarification with respect to using call activity data for estimating population distribution.},

	abstract = {Call detail records (CDRs) have recently been used in studying different aspects of human mobility. While CDRs provide a means of sampling user locations at large population scales, they may not sample all locations proportionate to the visitation frequency of a user, owing to sparsity in time and space of voice-calls, thereby introducing a bias. Also, as the rate of sampling is inherently dependent on the calling frequencies of an individual, high voice-call activity users are often chosen for conducting a meaningful study. Such a selection process can, inadvertently, lead to a biased view as high frequency callers may not always be representative of an entire population. With the advent of 3G technology and wide adoption of smart-phones, cellular devices have become versatile end-hosts. As the data accessed on these devices does not always require human initiation, it affords us with an unprecedented opportunity to validate the utility of CDRs for studying human mobility. In this work, we investigate various metrics for human mobility studied in literature for over a million cellular users in the San Francisco bay-area, for over a month. Our findings reveal that although the voice-call process does well to sample significant locations, such as home and work, it may in some cases incur biases in capturing the overall spatio-temporal characteristics of individual human mobility. Additionally, we motivate an "artificially" imposed sampling process, vis-a-vis the voice-call process with the same average intensity. We observe that in many cases such an imposed sampling process yields better performance results based on the usual metrics like entropies and marginal distributions used often in literature.},

This unique method of studying worker activity exposed the day-to-day dynamics of an industrial district with a precision thus far undocumented in literature.

	abstract = {BackgroundIn recent years, several path-breaking findings on human mobility patterns point out a novel issue which is of important theoretical significance and great application prospects. The empirical analysis of the data which can reflect the real-world human mobility provides the basic cognition and verification of the theoretical models and predictive results on human mobility. One of the most noticeable findings in previous studies on human mobility is the wide-spread scaling anomalies, e.g. the power-law-like displacement distributions. Understanding the origin of these scaling anomalies is of central importance to this issue and therefore is the focus of our discussion.Methodology/Principal FindingsIn this paper, we empirically analyze the real-world human movements which are based on GPS records, and observe rich scaling properties in the temporal-spatial patterns as well as an abnormal transition in the speed-displacement patterns together with an evidence to the real-world traffic jams. In addition, we notice that the displacements at the population level show a significant positive correlation, indicating a cascading-like nature in human movements. Furthermore, our analysis at the individual level finds that the displacement distributions of users with stronger correlations usually are closer to the power law, suggesting a correlation between the positive correlation of the displacement series and the form of an individual's displacement distribution.Conclusions/SignificanceThese empirical findings make connections between the two basic properties of human mobility, the scaling anomalies on displacement distributions and the positive correlations on displacement series, implying the cascading-like dynamics which is exhibited by the positive correlations would cause the emergence of scaling properties on human mobility patterns. Our findings would inspire further researches on mechanisms and predictions of human mobility.},

So far, particularly, the accelerometer has been extensively studied. In a few recent studies, a combination of a gyroscope, a magnetometer (in a supporting role) and an accelerometer (in a lead role) has been used with the aim to improve the recognition performance. How and when are various motion sensors, which are available on a smartphone, best used for better recognition performance, either individually or in combination? This is yet to be explored. In order to investigate this question, in this paper, we explore how these various motion sensors behave in different situations in the activity recognition process. For this purpose, we designed a data collection experiment where ten participants performed seven different activities carrying smart phones at different positions. Based on the analysis of this data set, we show that these sensors, except the magnetometer, are each capable of taking the lead roles individually, depending on the type of activity being recognized, the body position, the used data features and the classification method employed (personalized or generalized). We also show that their combination only improves the overall recognition performance when their individual performances are not very high, so that there is room for performance improvement. We have made our data set and our data collection application publicly available, thereby making our experiments reproducible.},

Unlike research that chartered urban mobility through individual travel surveys, our research determined the aggregate distribution of Rome's population over time by using the volume of call activity in mobile network cells as the unit of spatial analysis. In this paper, we first illustrate and confirm that there is significant regularity in urban mobility at different hours, days, and weeks.

	abstract = {Recent research has begun generating a much richer, activity-based behavioral framework to replace the conventional aggregate, four-step approaches. However, to date, the framework remains to be completed, at least enough to provide a robust behavioral foundation that incorporates household long-term behaviors with routine travel and activity patterns. The objective of this research is to explore aspects of activity-based urban modeling that could assist in understanding changing land use and transportation interactions as information technologies enable more complex measurement and modeling, and alter the economics of urban transportation by improving last-mile logistics and facilitating car sharing. The research focuses on specific issues and strategies for developing household, quasi-activity-based, urban modeling prototypes that could simulate the impacts of transport innovations in metropolitan areas. In our implementation and development of the Lisbon model, we started with case 0 first - the four-step travel demand model without considering any land use change. Then given the considerations of data and modeling purpose, what began as a standard version of the UrbanSim model linked to the four-step travel demand model (in Case 1) has evolved into a modified version of the UrbanSim connected to a uniquely formulated tour-based travel model (in Case 2) that not only adjusted the model specification for certain components, but also changed some of the assumptions about household behavior and heterogeneity. The modified UrbanSim model suggests some improvement over the standard version, in differentiating the accessibility for different types of households. However, it is still far from the considerations of household interactions that many planners consider important in the household long-term choices. One key objective of the research is to improve the ability of the models to simulate the impacts of transportation innovations on household-level activity patterns and residential location choice in metro Lisbon. Since transportation innovations and economic restructuring can trigger substantial changes in place/space/household interactions, household-level adjustments can involve changes in car ownership, trip chaining, repackaging of household trips and the like. Therefore, I propose an accessibility indicator that addresses these considerations when evaluating the attractiveness of destinations and modes. The indicators are measured at the household level and facilitate micro-simulation of residential location choice while accounting for household-specific trip chaining, scheduling, and mode choice options. This household quasi-activity- based urban modeling framework (Case 3), represents a progression of behavioral models that capture observably significant behavioral differences in Lisbon. In the simulation experiments, the quasi-household-activity-based urban modeling framework (Case 3) is applied only for two-worker households for which sufficient activity data are available in Lisbon. The quantitative results from simulating the urban development impacts of the proposed policy changes in the Lisbon Metropolitan in next 25 years under Case 0, Case 1, Case 2 and Case 3 demonstrate the progression of experiments with alternative strategies for incorporating key activity-based elements into LUTE models. The main contributions of the dissertation include the development and implementation of quasi-activity-based modeling framework and specific techniques to assess the impacts of transportation innovations and energy and environmental constraints on urban development patterns. This represents an alternative approach to the traditional land use and transportation interaction research and overcomes some major obstacles to model household activity and mobility. It also has significant applications for transportation and urban planning in the information and communication technology (ICT) age. The dissertation demonstrates the use of emerging information technologies, modern federated database management and distributed modeling techniques to facilitate the 'what if' analyses of changing land use and transportation circumstances, induced by the new ICTs in metropolitan areas.},

	abstract = {The study of human activity-travel patterns for transportation demand forecast has evolved a long way in theories, methodologies and applications. However, the scarcity of data has become a major barrier for the advancement of research in the field. At the same time, the proliferation of urban sensing and location-based devices generate voluminous streams of spatio-temporal registered information. These urban sensing data contain massive information on urban dynamics and individuals' mobility. For example, the transit smart card transaction data reveal the places that transit passengers visit at different times of day. As tempting as it appears to be, the incorporation of these urban sensing data into activity-travel study remains a big challenge, which demands new analytics, theories and frameworks to bridge the gap between the information observed directly from the imperfect urban sensing data and the knowledge about how people use the city. In this study, we propose a framework of analysis that focuses on the recurring processing and learning of voluminous transit smart card data flows in juxtaposition with additional auxiliary spatio-temporal data, which are used to improve our understanding of the context of the data. The framework consists of an ontology-based data integration process, a built environment measurement module, an activity-learning module and visualization examples that facilitate the exploration and investigation of activity-travel patterns. The ontology-based data integration approach helps to integrate and interpret spatio-temporal data from multiple sources in a systematic way. These spatio-temporally detailed data are used to formulate quantitative variables for the characterization of the context under which the travelers made their transit trips. In particular, a set of spatial metrics are computed to measure different dimensionalities of the urban built environment of trip destinations. In order to understand why people make trips to destinations, researchers and planners need to know the possible activities associated with observed transit trips. Therefore, an activity learning module is developed to infer the unknown activity types from millions of trips recorded in transit smart card transactions by learning the context dependent behaviors of travelers from a traditional household travel survey. The learned activities not only help the interpretation of the behavioral choices of transit riders, but also can be used to improve the characterization of urban built form by uncovering the likely activity landscapes of various places. The proposed framework and the methodology is demonstrated by focusing on the use of transit smart card transaction data, i.e., EZ-Link data, to study activity-travel patterns in Singapore. Although different modules of the framework are loosely coupled at the moment, we have tried to pipeline as much of the process as possible to facilitate efficient data processing and analysis. This allows researchers and planners to keep track of the evolution of human activity-travel patterns over time, and examine the correlations between the changes in activities and the changes in the built environment. The knowledge gained from continuous urban sensing data will certainly help policy makers and planners understand the current states of urban dynamics and monitor changes as transportation infrastructure and travel behaviors evolve over time.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores the role of social media in urban flooding. The author analyzes the activity of weibos (Chinese tweets) related to Beijing's "7.21" flash flood in the Sinaweibo system (the most popular social media open platform in China) and characterizes these weibos from the 37 hours following this disaster. In order to understand the response of the public to urban flash flooding, multiple methods are used, including trend analysis, content analysis for high frequent terms and co-occurrence words, and lexicon-based sentiment analysis. In particular, weibos with geo-location information were extracted to draw different sentiment maps for the city. Sentiment maps show the public emotion (polarity, intensity and type) geographically. Through these analyses, I set out to construct a framework to process massive amount of data generated by social media, and proposed a methodology for converting the data into actionable knowledge. This work explored extracting emotions from weibos, distilling crowd-wisdom by using filters and algorithms to smooth out the noise in the massive amount of data, and determining that human emotions closely correlated with severe natural disaster. By tracking human emotions, it was possible to track the progress of the disaster, and more importantly whether relief was provided to mitigate the disaster. Moreover, by projecting the emotional polarity, intensity and emotional type onto maps, the visualization can provide reasonably clear and timely picture of when and where the strongest emotions occurred. The methodology developed in this thesis could facilitate innovative approaches in the field of urban disaster planning.},

Most existing works have focused on the geometric properties of trajectories, but recently emerged the concept of semantic trajectories, in which the background geographic information is integrated to trajectory sample points. In this new concept, trajectories are observed as a set of stops and moves, where stops are the most important parts of the trajectory. Stops and moves have been computed by testing the intersections of trajectories with a set of geographic objects given by the user. In this paper we present an alternative solution with the capability of finding interesting places that are not expected by the user. The proposed solution is a spatio-temporal clustering method, based on speed, to work with single trajectories. We compare the two different approaches with experiments on real data and show that the computation of stops using the concept of speed can be interesting for several applications.},

Most of similarities are defined based on the geographic features of mobile users' trajectories. However, trajectories geographically close may not necessarily be similar because the activities implied by nearby landmarks they pass through may be different. In this paper, we argue that a better similarity measurement should have taken into account the semantics of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for recommending potential friends based on users' semantic trajectories for location-based social networks. The core of our proposal is a novel trajectory similarity measurement, namely, Maximal Semantic Trajectory Pattern Similarity (MSTP-Similarity), which measures the semantic similarity between trajectories. Accordingly, we propose a user similarity measurement based on MSTP-Similarity of user trajectories and use it as the basis for recommending potential friends to a user. Through experimental evaluation, the proposed friend recommendation approach is shown to deliver excellent performance.},

There has been previous work on this problem, e.g., using ad hoc algorithms [13]or K-Means clustering[4]; however, both approaches have shortcomings. This paper explores a deterministic, density-based clustering algorithm that also uses temporal techniques to reduce the number of uninteresting places that are discovered. We introduce a general framework for evaluating personal gazetteer discovery algorithms and use it to demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over previous approaches.},

Current measures of human mobility, especially in low-income settings, are often static, relying on approximate travel times, road networks, or cross-sectional surveys. Mobile phone data provide a unique source of information about human travel, but the power of these data to describe epidemiologically relevant changes in population density remains unclear. Here we quantify seasonal travel patterns using mobile phone data from nearly 15 million anonymous subscribers in Kenya. Using a rich data source of rubella incidence, we show that patterns of population travel (fluxes) inferred from mobile phone data are predictive of disease transmission and improve significantly on standard school term time and weather covariates. Further, combining seasonal and spatial data on travel from mobile phone data allows us to characterize seasonal fluctuations in risk across Kenya and produce dynamic importation risk maps for rubella. Mobile phone data therefore offer a valuable previously unidentified source of data for measuring key drivers of seasonal epidemics.},

	abstract = {Knowing where people are is critical for accurate impact assessments and intervention planning, particularly those focused on population health, food security, climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters. This study demonstrates how data collected by mobile phone network operators can cost-effectively provide accurate and detailed maps of population distribution over national scales and any time period while guaranteeing phone users{\textquoteright} privacy. The methods outlined may be applied to estimate human population densities in low-income countries where data on population distributions may be scarce, outdated, and unreliable, or to estimate temporal variations in population density. The work highlights how facilitating access to anonymized mobile phone data might enable fast and cheap production of population maps in emergency and data-scarce situations., During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also demonstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applications and a near real-time understanding of patterns and processes in human geography.},

	abstract = {A traveler{\textquoteright}s willingness to pay for travel time savings depends on his/her socio-economic characteristics, travel purpose, and situational factors such as time pressure under which the travel is undertaken. Earlier literature on value of time (VOT) analysis focused mostly on the first two factors but did not examine the last factor thoroughly. However, in the real world we expect that (at least in most cases) a worker would be willing to pay more during the before-work period than during the after-work period since most of the workers should reach their respective work places by a certain time while the after-work schedule in general should be more relaxed. The additional time pressure during the before-work period makes time more valuable, thus increasing VOT. In some cases, where a worker with a flexible schedule has a high-priority post-work activity with a fixed schedule (for example, tickets to a concert) the situation can be reversed. The current study aims to capture such impacts of daily activity patterns on a person{\textquoteright}s VOT using a comprehensive trip segmentation framework that is comprised of several integrated mode and trip departure time-of-day choice models. Each of these integrated models was estimated using both Revealed Preference and Stated Preference data from a large-scale GPS-assisted Household Travel Survey undertaken in Jerusalem, Israel. The results not only confirm the long-held hypothesis about variation of VOT by socio-economic factors and trip purpose but also shed light on the variation of VOT with daily travel patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop a rigorous modeling framework for capturing variation of VOT as a function of the individual daily activity pattern. An additional feature of the proposed approach is that it was practically implemented within the framework of an applied activity-based model.},

Through descriptive analyses and a random parameters panel effects regression model, we analyze changes in the time spent on shopping between two consecutive waves of the panel differentiating between employment status transitions, after controlling for a set of socio-demographic variables and day of the week. Results indicate that while activity-travel patterns in general and shopping duration in particular are relatively stable for the groups showing no transitions in employment status, the transition groups show evidence of a reorganization of their shopping activities across the week. In addition, results of the model indicate that the relationship between change in employment status and dynamics in shopping behavior is not symmetrical.},

	abstract = {Discrete choices are often analyzed statically. The limitations of static models become more obvious when employing them in more long-term travel demand forecasting. The research gap lies in a theoretical model which is dynamically formulated, and in readily available longitudinal data sources. To address this, a heterogeneous hidden Markov modeling approach (HMM) is proposed in this paper to model dynamic discrete choices. Both longitudinal and cross-sectional heterogeneity are considered. The approach is demonstrated on a travel mode choice application using ten-wave Puget Sound Transport Panel data coupled with some other supplementary data sources. Results indicate that travelers{\textquoteright} long-term life-cycle stages have an enduring impact when shifted to different mode choice states, wherein sensitivities to travel time and cost vary. Empirical results are put in line with static discrete choice models. The paper demonstrates that the family of HMM models provide the best fitting model. The dynamic model has superior explanatory power in fitting longitudinal data and thus shall provide more accurate estimates for planning and policy analyses. The proposed approach can be generalized to study other short/mid-term travel behavior. The estimated model can be easily calibrated and transferred for applications elsewhere.},

This work presents a novel approach to obtain this highly valuable knowledge. We hereby propose a segmentation of a city into clusters based on activity profiles using data from a Location Based Social Network (LBSN). In our approach, a segment is represented by different locations sharing the same temporal distribution of check-ins. We reveal how to describe the topic of the determined segments by modelling the difference to the overall temporal distribution of check-ins of the region. Furthermore, a technique from multidimensional scaling is adopted to compute a classification of all segments and visualize the results. The proposed method was successfully applied to Foursquare data recorded from May to October 2012 in the region of Cologne (Germany) and returns clear patterns separating areas known for different activities like nightlife or daily work. Finally, we discuss different aspects related to the use of data from LBSNs.},

First, how to infer real-time air quality of any arbitrary location given environmental data and historical air quality data from very sparse monitoring locations. Second, if one needs to establish few new monitoring stations to improve the inference quality, how to determine the best locations for such purpose? The problems are challenging since for most of the locations ({\textgreater}99\%) in a city we do not have any air quality data to train a model from. We design a semi-supervised inference model utilizing existing monitoring data together with heterogeneous city dynamics, including meteorology, human mobility, structure of road networks, and point of interests (POIs). We also propose an entropy-minimization model to suggest the best locations to establish new monitoring stations. We evaluate the proposed approach using Beijing air quality data, resulting in clear advantages over a series of state-of-the-art and commonly used methods.},

With recent advances in activity-based land use, transportation, and environment (LUTE) models, such disaggregated land use data become important to allow LUTE models to analyze and simulate a person{\textquoteright}s choices of work location and activity destinations and to understand policy impacts on future cities. These data can also be used as alternatives to explore economic activities at the local level, especially as government-published census-based disaggregated employment data have become less available in the recent decade. Our new approach provides opportunities for cities to estimate land use at high resolution with low cost by utilizing VGI while ensuring its quality with a certain accuracy threshold. The automatic classification of POI can also be utilized for other types of analyses on cities.},

We obtained hourly aggregated cellphone data from a dataset of communications in Lisbon, Portugal. Fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm was applied to the cellphone data to create clusters of locations with similar features in two aspects of activities: the pattern and intensity of urban activities along the hours of a day. In order to validate those clusters as actual predictors of human activity, we compared them with clusters formed using ground truth variables namely presence of people, buildings, points of interest, and bus and taxi movement. To identify the patterns of urban activities, the Erlang data provided a better match, with the ground truth giving 69\% of overall accurate predictions. In the case of the intensity of activities, Handover data provided the highest match, with the ground truth yielding 80\% of overall accuracy of predictions. Hence, the results demonstrate the potential of passive mobile positioning data in detecting intensity of activities that are superimposed on the different activity patterns, which is a fundamental piece of information for transportation and urban planning.},

By comparing whole cities typical patterns, we provide insights on how cultural, technological and economical factors shape human dynamics. At a more local scale, we use clustering analysis to identify locations with similar patterns within a city. Our research reveals a universal structure of cities, with core financial centers all sharing similar activity patterns and commercial or residential areas with more city-specific patterns. These findings hint that as the economy becomes more global, common patterns emerge in business areas of different cities across the globe, while the impact of local conditions still remains recognizable on the level of routine people activity.},

	abstract = {The recent emergence of dengue viruses into new susceptible human populations throughout Asia and the Middle East, driven in part by human travel on both local and global scales, represents a significant global health risk, particularly in areas with changing climatic suitability for the mosquito vector. In Pakistan, dengue has been endemic for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but large epidemics in the northeast have emerged only since 2011. Pakistan is therefore representative of many countries on the verge of countrywide endemic dengue transmission, where prevention, surveillance, and preparedness are key priorities in previously dengue-free regions. We analyze spatially explicit dengue case data from a large outbreak in Pakistan in 2013 and compare the dynamics of the epidemic to an epidemiological model of dengue virus transmission based on climate and mobility data from \~{}40 million mobile phone subscribers. We find that mobile phone-based mobility estimates predict the geographic spread and timing of epidemics in both recently epidemic and emerging locations. We combine transmission suitability maps with estimates of seasonal dengue virus importation to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.},

Our bottom-up approach uses basic data related to each landfill to achieve a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of impact of landfill odors. Results reveal that the average radius of impact of landfill odors in China is 796~m, while most landfills (46.85\%) are within the range of 400{\textendash}1000~m, in line with the results from previous studies. The total land area impacted by odors has reached 837,476~ha, accounting for 0.09\% of China's land territory. Guangdong and Sichuan provinces have the largest land areas impacted by odors, while Tibet Autonomous Region and Tianjin Municipality have the smallest. According to the CALPUFF (California Puff) model and an analysis of social big data, the overall uncertainty of our calculation of the range of odor impacts is roughly~-32.88\% to 32.67\%. This type of study is essential for gaining an accurate and detailed estimation of the affected human population and will prove valuable for addressing the current Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) challenge in China.},

The TBP is an extension of the well-known descriptive statistics Box Plot concept. Each TBP is described by a median trajectory, a 3D box and a 3D fence. The median trajectory depicts the typical movement of mobile objects. The box and the fences (whiskers) describe the spatial and temporal spreading around the central tendency. TBPs are useful to summarize and analyse trajectory streams, understand their spatio-temporal density and detect outliers. In this article, visual analysis highlights how the TBP pattern effectively describes how the density of trajectory clusters change over time.},

The start and end points of each trajectory determine the origin and destination zone. Link counts are used to project the sample of mobile phone movements to the broader movement of cars, trucks, and rail passengers. With results of a clustering process of traffic counts, O-D matrices for typical traffic days are computed. The resulting O-D matrices can be used for a long-term traffic state forecast.},

	abstract = {While the relationship between urban form and travel behavior is a key element of many current planning initiatives aimed at reducing car travel, the literature faces two major problems. First, this relationship is extremely complex. Second, several specification and estimation issues are poorly addressed in prior work, possibly generating biased results.

We argue that many of the latter problems are overcome by systematically isolating the separable influences of urban design characteristics on travel and then properly analyzing individual-level data. We further clarify which results directly follow from alternative land use arrangements and which may or may not, and thus identify the specific hypotheses to be tested against the data. We then develop more-reliable tests of these hypotheses, and explore the implications of alternative behavioral assumptions regarding travel costs. The measured influence of land use on travel behavior is shown to be very sensitive to the form of the empirical strategy.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the huge worldwide mobile-phone penetration is increasingly turning the mobile network into a gigantic ubiquitous sensing platform, enabling large-scale analysis and applications. In recent years, mobile data-based research reaches important conclusions about various aspects of human mobility patterns and trajectories. But how accurately do these conclusions reflect the reality? In order to evaluate the difference between the reality and the approximation methods, we study in this paper the error between real human trajectory and the one obtained through mobile phone data using different interpolation methods (linear, cubic, nearest and spline interpolations) while taking into account some mobility parameters. From extensive evaluations based on real cellular network activity data of the Boston metropolitan area, we show that the linear interpolation offers the best estimation for sedentary people and the cubic one for commuters. Moreover, the nearest interpolation appears as the best one for {\textquotedblleft}ordinary people{\textquotedblright} doing regular stops and standard displacements. Another important experimental finding described in this paper is that trajectory estimation methods show different error regimes whether used within or outside the {\textquotedblleft}territory{\textquotedblright} of the user defined by the radius of gyration.},

Time geography, which examines human activities under various constraints in a space{\textendash}time context, provides a useful framework to analyze the complex spatio-temporal relationships among activities and interactions taking place in both physical and virtual spaces.

The developed model has the potential to calculate land use compatibility in both horizontal and vertical directions. Furthermore, the compatibility between the use of each floor in a building and its neighboring land uses can be evaluated. The method was tested in a built-up urban area located in Tehran, the capital city of Iran. The results show that the model is robust in clarifying different levels of physical compatibility between neighboring land uses.

Since the development of ICTs also impacts physical movement of individuals in societies, much of the existing research has focused on examining the correlation between ICT and human mobility. In this paper, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of how usage of mobile phones correlates with individual travel behavior by exploring the correlation between mobile phone call frequencies and three indicators of travel behavior: (1) radius, (2) eccentricity, and (3) entropy. The methodology is applied to a large dataset from Harbin city in China. The statistical analysis indicates a significant correlation between mobile phone usage and all of the three indicators. In addition, we examine and demonstrate how explanatory factors, such as age, gender, social temporal orders and characteristics of the built environment, impact the relationship between mobile phone usage and individual activity behavior.},

The increasing availability of large amounts of spatio-temporal data pertaining to an individual's trajectories has given rise to a variety of geographic information systems, and also brings us opportunities and challenges to automatically discover valuable knowledge from these trajectories. In this paper, we move towards this direction and aim to geographically mine the similarity between users based on their location histories. Such user similarity is significant to individuals, communities and businesses by helping them effectively retrieve the information with high relevance. A framework, referred to as hierarchical-graph-based similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed for geographic information systems to consistently model each individual's location history and effectively measure the similarity among users. In this framework, we take into account both the sequence property of people's movement behaviors and the hierarchy property of geographic spaces. We evaluate this framework using the GPS data collected by 65 volunteers over a period of 6 months in the real world. As a result, HGSM outperforms related similarity measures, such as the cosine similarity and Pearson similarity measures.},

It compares empirical results of the different methods based on the data from a six-week travel diary. In general, the results show that the day-to-day behaviour is more variable if measured with trip-based methods instead of methods based on time budgets. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the similarity declines if the method captures more of the complexity of the travel pattern. It is also shown that travel behaviour is neither totally repetitious nor totally variable. Even for the whole observation period, it is demonstrated that two days always have some common elements. Additionally, it is found that the different methods yield the same pattern of variability for different types of day. Travel behaviour is clearly more stable on work days. Similar results for all methods are also obtained concerning the question of how long the minimum period of observation should be. All measures show that the period should not be less than two weeks if one aims at measuring variability.},

	abstract = {Quantitative understanding of human behaviors provides elementary comprehension of the complexity of many human-initiated systems. A basic assumption embedded in the previous analyses on human dynamics is that its temporal statistics are uniform and stationary, which can be properly described by a Poisson process. Accordingly, the interevent time distribution should have an exponential tail. However, recently, this assumption is challenged by the extensive evidence, ranging from communication to entertainment and work patterns, that the human dynamics obeys non-Poisson statistics with heavy-tailed interevent time distribution. This review article summarizes the recent empirical explorations on human activity pattern, as well as the corresponding theoretical models for both task-driven and interest-driven systems. Finally, we outline some future open questions in the studies of the statistical mechanics of human dynamics.},

In particular the fine granularity of the location data, with GPS accuracy down to 10 meters, and the worldwide scale of Foursquare adoption are unprecedented. In this paper we study urban mobility patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing a large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in human movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are predominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban environments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which isolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of places between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as considered in some previous works. Building on our findings, we also show how a rank-based movement model accurately captures real human movements in different cities.},

The proposed technique uses unsupervised learning and automatically determines land uses in urban areas by clustering geographical regions with similar tweeting activity patterns. Three case studies are presented and validated for Manhattan (NYC), London (UK) and Madrid (Spain) using Twitter activity and land use information provided by the city planning departments. Results indicate that geolocated tweets can be used as a powerful data source for urban planning applications.},

Up to now, these matrices have been typically generated from data obtained from surveys. Nevertheless, such approaches typically involve high costs which limits the frequency of the studies. Cell phones can be considered one of the main sensors of human behavior due to its ubiquity, and as a such, a pervasive source of mobility information at a large scale. In this paper we propose a new technique for the estimation of commuting matrices using the data collected from the pervasive infrastructure of a cell phone network. Our goal is to show that we can construct cell-phone generated matrices that capture the same patterns as traditional commuting matrices. In order to do so we use optimization techniques in combination with a variation of Temporal Association Rules. Our validation results show that it is possible to construct commuting matrices from call detail records with a high degree of accuracy, and as a result our technique is a cost-effective solution to complement traditional approaches.},

In the past few years, some innovative approaches have sought to use mobile devices to collect spatiotemporal data. But little research has been done to develop and analyze the much larger samples of existing data generated daily by mobile networks. The most common explanation for this is that the challenge of data-sharing with the telecommunications industry has hampered data access. However, in early 2006, a collaboration between Telecom Italia, which serves 40 percent of the Roman market, and MIT's SKNSEable City Laboratory (http://senseable.mit.edu) allowed unprecedented access to aggregate mobile phone data from Rome. Here, we explore how researchers might be able to use data for an entire metropolitan region to analyze urban dynamics.},

A framework based on a hidden Markov model is proposed to construct a pattern of spatio-temporal movement of people in each grid during each time period. The numbers of GPS points and unique users in each grid were used as features and evaluated. We also introduced the use of local score to improve the accuracy of the event detection. In addition, we utilized Hadoop, a cloud-computing platform, to accelerate the processing speed and allow the handling of large-scale data.

	abstract = {The increase in urban mobility is one of the key issues of contemporary cities. The need for new types of data and representations useful to describe the new forms of daily urban mobility is widely known. The wider urban scale {\textendash} named urban region {\textendash} is the scale at which most of the urban and socio-economical phenomena are visible. Urban growth patterns, settlements and activities distribution, demographics and economics dynamics can be fully understood and interpreted at this macro scale, which is not recognizable on the administrative boundaries. The aim of this paper is to present three approaches to mobility mapping based on different data sources, both traditional and innovative, for the Milan urban region (Northern Italy). Traditional sources for the analysis of daily mobility are Census data or surveys based on interviews to mobile populations. They provide a very partial picture of the mobility practices in urban areas, because they collect only flows for job and study purposes. Innovative sources of data are mobile phone activity data that have been used for building a sequence of mobility maps in a typical working day. The Main Map is therefore composed of two parts: a representation of systematic and non-systematic mobility in the Milan urban region; and a sequence of maps created by using telephone traffic data showing daily mobility patterns. These maps can provide useful information for understanding the recent changes that had occurred in the Milan urban region, but they can also offer a methodological reference for the analysis of mobility in general.},

	abstract = {Assumptions about the effects of various land-use characteristics on travel patterns have found their way into diverse concepts of planning and design, such as the compact city and neighbourhood-design principles. In general, these concepts aim at reducing travel distances and reducing car-travel speed, as it is assumed that as travel distances are shorter, individuals will travel less, and the relative competitive position of slower modes is increased. Although some literature supports the link between land use and travel behaviour, for the greater part limited effects have been concluded, whereas in others it has been concluded that there is virtually no effect. We argue that the effects fall short of the expectations advocated by the land-use concepts, because of shortcomings behind assumptions concerning the relationships between land use and travel behaviour. We argue that utility-based and activity-based theories add some extra insights. Various behavioural responses in terms of travel-time changes are possible, depending on whether travel time is minimised, benefits maximised, or activity patterns optimised. It is concluded that the contribution of compact urban designs to reduction on travel may not be as straightforward as is suggested by their advocates. In any case, a simplified distance-oriented and trip-oriented approach is unable to examine complex behaviour, and a broader framework of space and time is needed.},

This paper proposes a novel, fine-grained approach to regional delineation, based on analyzing networks of billions of individual human transactions. Given a geographical area and some measure of the strength of links between its inhabitants, we show how to partition the area into smaller, non-overlapping regions while minimizing the disruption to each person's links. We tested our method on the largest non-Internet human network, inferred from a large telecommunications database in Great Britain. Our partitioning algorithm yields geographically cohesive regions that correspond remarkably well with administrative regions, while unveiling unexpected spatial structures that had previously only been hypothesized in the literature. We also quantify the effects of partitioning, showing for instance that the effects of a possible secession of Wales from Great Britain would be twice as disruptive for the human network than that of Scotland.},

	abstract = {Background The recent advancement in array CGH (aCGH) research has significantly improved tumor identification using DNA copy number data. A number of unsupervised learning methods have been proposed for clustering aCGH samples. Two of the major challenges for developing aCGH sample clustering are the high spatial correlation between aCGH markers and the low computing efficiency. A mixture hidden Markov model based algorithm was developed to address these two challenges. Results The hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to model the spatial correlation between aCGH markers. A fast clustering algorithm was implemented and real data analysis on glioma aCGH data has shown that it converges to the optimal cluster rapidly and the computation time is proportional to the sample size. Simulation results showed that this HMM based clustering (HMMC) method has a substantially lower error rate than NMF clustering. The HMMC results for glioma data were significantly associated with clinical outcomes. Conclusions We have developed a fast clustering algorithm to identify tumor subtypes based on DNA copy number aberrations. The performance of the proposed HMMC method has been evaluated using both simulated and real aCGH data. The software for HMMC in both R and C++ is available in ND INBRE website http://ndinbre.org/programs/bioinformatics.php.},

Naively matching the GPS sampling points with noise to the nearest road will result in some unreasonable map matching results, while this algorithm takes into account the location information suggested by GPS point and the road link transition probability. Also no more traffic information is needed in the procedure, which has a high accuracy and generalization ability. The algorithm was test with the real-word GPS data on a complex road network.

This paper describes a novel, principled map matching algorithm that uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to find the most likely road route represented by a time-stamped sequence of latitude/longitude pairs. The HMM elegantly accounts for measurement noise and the layout of the road network. We test our algorithm on ground truth data collected from a GPS receiver in a vehicle. Our test shows how the algorithm breaks down as the sampling rate of the GPS is reduced. We also test the effect of increasing amounts of additional measurement noise in order to assess how well our algorithm could deal with the inaccuracies of other location measurement systems, such as those based on WiFi and cell tower multilateration. We provide our GPS data and road network representation as a standard test set for other researchers to use in their map matching work.},

	abstract = {Map-matching is the process of aligning a sequence of observed user positions with the road network on a digital map. It is a fundamental pre-processing step for many applications, such as moving object management, traffic flow analysis, and driving directions. In practice there exists huge amount of low-sampling-rate (e.g., one point every 2--5 minutes) GPS trajectories. Unfortunately, most current map-matching approaches only deal with high-sampling-rate (typically one point every 10--30s) GPS data, and become less effective for low-sampling-rate points as the uncertainty in data increases. In this paper, we propose a novel global map-matching algorithm called ST-Matching for low-sampling-rate GPS trajectories. ST-Matching considers (1) the spatial geometric and topological structures of the road network and (2) the temporal/speed constraints of the trajectories. Based on spatio-temporal analysis, a candidate graph is constructed from which the best matching path sequence is identified. We compare ST-Matching with the incremental algorithm and Average-Fr{\'e}chet-Distance (AFD) based global map-matching algorithm. The experiments are performed both on synthetic and real dataset. The results show that our ST-matching algorithm significantly outperform incremental algorithm in terms of matching accuracy for low-sampling trajectories. Meanwhile, when compared with AFD-based global algorithm, ST-Matching also improves accuracy as well as running time.},

Trajectory data are normally available as sample points, and do not carry semantic information, which is of fundamental importance for the comprehension of these data. Therefore, the analysis of trajectory data becomes expensive from a computational point of view and complex from a user's perspective. Enriching trajectories with semantic geographical information may simplify queries, analysis, and mining of moving object data. In this paper we propose a data preprocessing model to add semantic information to trajectories in order to facilitate trajectory data analysis in different application domains. The model is generic enough to represent the important parts of trajectories that are relevant to the application, not being restricted to one specific application. We present an algorithm to compute the important parts and show that the query complexity for the semantic analysis of trajectories will be significantly reduced with the proposed model.},

	abstract = {We analyze the passengers' traffic pattern for 1.58 million taxi trips of Shanghai, China. By employing the non-negative matrix factorization and optimization methods, we find that, people travel on workdays mainly for three purposes: commuting between home and workplace, traveling from workplace to workplace, and others such as leisure activities. Therefore, traffic flow in one area or between any pair of locations can be approximated by a linear combination of three basis flows, corresponding to the three purposes respectively. We name the coefficients in the linear combination as traffic powers, each of which indicates the strength of each basis flow. The traffic powers on different days are typically different even for the same location, due to the uncertainty of the human motion. Therefore, we provide a probability distribution function for the relative deviation of the traffic power. This distribution function is in terms of a series of functions for normalized binomial distributions. It can be well explained by statistical theories and is verified by empirical data. These findings are applicable in predicting the road traffic, tracing the traffic pattern and diagnosing the traffic related abnormal events. These results can also be used to infer land uses of urban area quite parsimoniously.},

Our approach results four major benefits, which can be highlighted as: (i) the model initialization problem is solved by associating the ensemble technique; (ii) the appropriate cluster number can be automatically determined by applying proposed consensus function on the multiple partitions obtained from the target dataset during clustering ensemble phase; (iii) no parameter re-estimation is required for the new merged pair of cluster, which significantly reduces the computing cost of its final refinement process based on HMM agglomerative clustering; and finally (iv) the composite model is better in characterizing the complex structure of clusters.

	title = {Exploring the power of heterogeneous information sources},
	shorttitle = {The big data challenge is one unique opportunity for both data mining and database research and engineering. {A} vast ocean of data are collected from trillions of connected devices in real time on a daily basis, and useful knowledge is usually buried in data of multiple genres, from different sources, in different formats, and with different types of representation. {Many} interesting patterns cannot be extracted from a single data collection, but have to be discovered from the integrative analysis of all heterogeneous data sources available. {Although} many algorithms have been developed to analyze multiple information sources, real applications continuously pose new challenges: {Data} can be gigantic, noisy, unreliable, dynamically evolving, highly imbalanced, and heterogeneous. {Meanwhile}, users provide limited feedback, have growing privacy concerns, and ask for actionable knowledge. {In} this thesis, we proposed to explore the power of multiple heterogeneous information sources in such challenging learning scenarios. {There} are two interesting perspectives in learning from the correlations among multiple information sources: {Explore} their similarities (consensus combination), or their differences (inconsistency detection). {In} consensus combination, we focused on the task of classification with multiple information sources. {Multiple} information sources for the same set of objects can provide complimentary predictive powers, and by combining their expertise, the prediction accuracy is significantly improved. {However}, the major challenge is that it is hard to obtain sufficient and reliable labeled data for effective training because they require the efforts of experienced human annotators. {In} some data sources, we may only have a large amount of unlabeled data. {Although} such unlabel information do not directly generate label predictions, they provide useful constraints on the classification task. {Therefore}, we first propose a graph based consensus maximization framework to combine multiple supervised and unsupervised models obtained from all the available information sources. {We} further demonstrate the benefits of combining multiple models on two specific learning scenarios. {In} transfer learning, we propose an effective model combination framework to transfer knowledge from multiple sources to a target domain with no labeled data. {We} also demonstrate the robustness of model combination on dynamically evolving data. {On} the other hand, when unexpected disagreement is encountered across diverse information sources, this might raise a red flag and require in-depth investigation. {Another} line of my thesis research is to explore differences among multiple information sources to find anomalies. {We} first propose a spectral method to detect objects performing inconsistently across multiple heterogeneous information sources as a new type of anomalies. {Traditional} anomaly detection methods discover anomalies based on the degree of deviation from normal objects in one data source, whereas the proposed approach detects anomalies according to the degree of inconsistencies across multiple sources. {The} principle of inconsistency detection can benefit many applications, and in particular, we show how this principle can help identify anomalies in information networks and distributed systems. {We} propose probabilistic models to detect anomalies in a social community by comparing link and node information, and to detect system problems from connected machines in a distributed systems by modeling correlations among multiple machines. {In} this thesis, we go beyond the scope of traditional ensemble learning to address challenges faced by many applications with multiple data sources. {With} the proposed consensus combination framework, labeled data are no longer a requirement for successful multi-source classification, instead, the use of existing labeling experts were maximized by integrating knowledge from relevant domains and unlabeled information sources. {The} proposed concept of inconsistency detection across multiple data sources opens up a new direction of anomaly detection. {The} detected anomalies, which cannot be found by traditional anomaly detection techniques, provide new insights into the application area. {The} algorithms we developed have been proved useful in many areas, including social network analysis, cyber-security, and business intelligence, and have the potential of being applied to many other areas, such as healthcare, bioinformatics, and energy efficiency. {As} both the amount of data and the number of sources in our world have been exploding, there are still great opportunities as well as numerous research challenges for inference of actionable knowledge from multiple heterogeneous sources of massive data collections.},

	abstract = {The collection of huge amount of tracking data made possible by the widespread use of GPS devices, enabled the analysis of such data for several applications domains, ranging from traffic management to advertisement and social studies. However, the raw positioning data, as it is detected by GPS devices, lacks of semantic information since this data does not natively provide any additional contextual information like the places that people visited or the activities performed. Traditionally, this information is collected by hand filled questionnaire where a limited number of users are asked to annotate their tracks with the activities they have done. With the purpose of getting large amount of semantically rich trajectories, we propose an algorithm for automatically annotating raw trajectories with the activities performed by the users. To do this, we analyse the stops points trying to infer the Point Of Interest (POI) the user has visited. Based on the category of the POI and a probability measure based on the gravity law, we infer the activity performed. We experimented and evaluated the method in a real case study of car trajectories, manually annotated by users with their activities. Experimental results are encouraging and will drive our future works.},

	abstract = {Home-work commuting has always attracted significant research attention because of its impact on human mobility. One of the key assumptions in this domain of study is the universal uniformity of commute times. However, a true comparison of commute patterns has often been hindered by the intrinsic differences in data collection methods, which make observation from different countries potentially biased and unreliable. In the present work, we approach this problem through the use of mobile phone call detail records (CDRs), which offers a consistent method for investigating mobility patterns in wholly different parts of the world. We apply our analysis to a broad range of datasets, at both the country (Portugal, Ivory Coast, and Saudi Arabia), and city (Boston) scale. Additionally, we compare these results with those obtained from vehicle GPS traces in Milan. While different regions have some unique commute time characteristics, we show that the home-work time distributions and average values within a single region are indeed largely independent of commute distance or country (Portugal, Ivory Coast, and Boston){\textendash}despite substantial spatial and infrastructural differences. Furthermore, our comparative analysis demonstrates that such distance-independence holds true only if we consider multimodal commute behaviors{\textendash}as consistent with previous studies. In car-only (Milan GPS traces) and car-heavy (Saudi Arabia) commute datasets, we see that commute time is indeed influenced by commute distance.

Statistical and data mining techniques, as proposed in this paper, go a long way in improving our knowledge about human activities extracted from travel surveys. As of today, most urban simulators have not yet incorporated the various types of individuals by their daily activities. In this work, we detect clusters of individuals by daily activity patterns, integrated with their usage of space and time, and show that daily routines can be highly predictable, with clear differences depending on the group, e.g. students vs. part time workers. This analysis presents the basis to capture collective activities at large scales and expand our perception of urban structure from the spatial dimension to spatial-temporal dimension. It will be helpful for planers to understand how individuals utilize time and interact with urban space in metropolitan areas and crucial for the design of sustainable cities in the future.},

However, slower progress is being made in activity recognition which remains often unreliable in everyday environments. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage the increasing capacity to gather data at a population-scale towards improving existing models of human behavior. Specifically, we consider the various social phenomena and environmental factors that cause people to develop correlated behavioral patterns, especially within communities connected by strong social ties. Reasons underpinning correlated behavior include shared externalities (e.g., work schedules, weather, traffic conditions), that shape options and decisions; and cases of adopted behavior, as people learn from each other or assume group norms due to social pressure. Most existing approaches to modeling human behavior ignore all of these phenomena and recognize activities solely on the basis of sensor data captured from a single individual. We propose the Networked Community Behavior (NCB) framework for activity recognition, specifically designed to exploit community-scale behavioral patterns. Under NCB, patterns of community behavior are mined to identify social ties that can signal correlated behavior, this information is used to augment sensor-based inferences available from the actions of individuals. Our evaluation of NCB shows it is able to outperform existing approaches to behavior modeling across four mobile sensing datasets that collectively require a diverse set of activities to be recognized.},

The main contribution of this article is the design of a framework where semantic trajectories and semantic events are linked to provide an enriched description of a situation. To test this approach, a prototype was developed where experts can model and then analyze vessels{\textquoteright} trajectories.

This data source offers good potential for the monitoring of the geography and mobility of the population, since mobile phones are widespread, and similar standardized data can be used around the globe. We developed the model and tested it with 12 months' data collected by EMT, Estonia's largest mobile service provider, covering more than 0.5 million anonymous respondents. Modeling results were compared with population register data; this revealed that the developed model described the geography of the population relatively well, and can hence be used in geographical and urban studies.

Taxi cabs{\textquoteright} trajectory data in the city of San Francisco were analyzed to identify activity instances, activity hot spots, and space{\textendash}time dynamics of activity hot spots. The urban activity hot spots, evolving through different stages and across the city, provide a comprehensive depiction of the space{\textendash}time activity patterns in the urban landscape. The dynamic patterns of the activity hot spots can be used to retrieve historical events and to predict future activity hot spots, which may be valuable for transportation and public safety management.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an original approach to dynamic anomalous behavior detection in individual trajectory using a recursive Bayesian filter. The anomalous pattern detection is of great interest for navigation, driver assistance systems, surveillance as well as crisis management. In this work, we focus on the GPS trajectories of automobiles finding where the driver{\textquoteright}s behavior shows anomalies. Such anomalous behaviors can happen in many cases, especially when the driver encounters orientation problems, i.e., taking a wrong turn, performing a detour, or losing the way. First, three high-level features, i.e., turns and their density, detour factor, and route repetition are extracted from the given trajectory geometry, for which a long-term perspective is required to observe data sequences of a significant length instead of individual time stamps. We therefore employ high-order Markov chains with a {\textquoteleft}dynamic memory{\textquoteright} to model the trajectory integrating these long-term features. The Markov model is processed by a proposed recursive Bayesian filter to infer an optimal probability distribution of the potential anomalous driving behaviors dynamically over time. The filter performs unsupervised detection in single trajectories based on local features only. No training process is required to characterize the anomalous behaviors. By analyzing the detection results of individual trajectories, collective behaviors can be derived indicating traffic issues such as congestions and turn restrictions. Experiments are performed on volunteered geographic information (VGI) data, self-acquired trajectories, and open trajectory datasets to demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.},

But generally raw GPS traces do not include information on trip purposes or activities. Earlier studies addressed this issue through a combination of manual and computer-assisted data processing steps. Nevertheless, geographic context databases provide the possibility for automatic activity identification based on GPS trajectories since each activity is uniquely defined by a set of features such as location and duration. Distinguished with most existing methods using two dimensional factors, this paper presents a novel approach using spatial temporal attractiveness of POIs (Point of Interests) to identify activity-locations as well as durations from raw GPS trajectory. We also introduce an algorithm to figure out how the intersections of trajectories and spatial-temporal attractiveness prisms indicate the potential possibilities for activities. Finally, Experiments using real world GPS tracking data, road networks and POIs are conducted for evaluations of the proposed approach.},

The widespread use of location-awareness devices provides a novel data source for constructing spatially embedded networks and uncovering spatial features of different population groups. Using an empirical mobile phone data-set, this paper attempts to explore the spatial distributions and human mobility patterns, as well as the interrelationship between them, at the community level. Three spatial patterns of communities are identified with the community detection algorithm and kernel density map method: single-centred distribution, dual-centred distribution and zonal distribution. We find different movement characteristics of these three community types by analysing angle distribution of trajectories and radius of gyration of users. Furthermore, we analyse spatial and temporal travel patterns for the users in dual-centred communities. The results indicate that people{\textquoteright}s commuting travel brings about spatial interaction between urban district and suburbs, and verify our hypothesis that the distance decay effect along with social phenomena such as the home{\textendash}work separation contributes to the formation of different community distributions.},

The original data investigated in this paper were collected by cellular networks in a southern city of China, recording the population distribution by dividing the city into thousands of pixels. The space{\textendash}time structure of urban dynamics is explored by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the original data, from temporal and spatial perspectives between which there is a dual relation. Based on the results of the analysis, we have discovered four underlying rules of urban dynamics: low intrinsic dimensionality, three categories of common patterns, dominance of periodic trends, and temporal stability. It implies that the space{\textendash}time structure can be captured well by remarkably few temporal or spatial predictable periodic patterns, and the structure unearthed by PCA evolves stably over time. All these features play a critical role in the applications of forecasting and anomaly detection.},

However, gaining a greater understanding of how they merge to define the urban morphology remains a substantial scientific challenge. Toward this goal, this paper addresses the opportunities presented by the emergence of crowdsourced data to gain novel insights into form and function in urban spaces. We are focusing in particular on information harvested from social media and other open-source and volunteered datasets (e.g. trajectory and OpenStreetMap data). These data provide a first-hand account of form and function from the people who define urban space through their activities. This novel bottom-up approach to study these concepts complements traditional urban studies to provide a new lens for studying urban activity. By synthesizing recent advancements in the analysis of open-source data, we provide a new typology for characterizing the role of crowdsourcing in the study of urban morphology. We illustrate this new perspective by showing how social media, trajectory, and traffic data can be analyzed to capture the evolving nature of a city{\textquoteright}s form and function. While these crowd contributions may be explicit or implicit in nature, they are giving rise to an emerging research agenda for monitoring, analyzing, and modeling form and function for urban design and analysis.},

	abstract = {Theories on the reciprocal relationship between land-use and transport address changes in locational decisions and travel behavior of private actors (households and firms) due to alternations in the transport system, respectively land-use system. Although the impact of land-use system on travel behaviour (transport system) has been the subject of much research (for reviews, see, e.g. Handy, 2002; Stead and Marshall, 2001; Crane, 2000; Wegener and F{\"u}rst, 1999), there is still no consensus about the strength of this relationship. This may be caused by different types of variables whether or not included in the research. Initially only land-use variables were taken into account, but nowadays socio-economical variables are also incorporated. Still, within {\textquoteleft}homogeneous groups{\textquoteright}, there may be attitudes, lifestyles, perceptions, and preferences which can have an impact on land-use and/or travel behaviour. Academic literature on the latter remains scarce and the main focus of the existing behavioural literature is the impact of residential location on travel choices, especially modal choice. However, little work has thus far been done on other dimensions of travel choices (e.g., distance, time) and other location types (e.g., commercial, industrial, recreational). Less is known about the reverse relationship, e.g. the impact of the transport system on location decisions of households and firms (land-use system). A difference in time-scale can be the reason for this. Transformations in land-use occur much slower (years) compared to transformations in travel behaviour (days, weeks, months). In this paper we explore several possibilities to fill in some of the gaps in our knowledge on the land-use/transport system. Understanding the two-way interaction between land-use and travel behaviour involves having (i) data on land-use patterns, socio-economic background of individuals and their attitudes, perceptions and preferences towards land-use and travel; and (ii) a methodology, dealing with potential multiple directions of causality. The first issue can be achieved by combining empirical, revealed and stated preference research. The second methodological question can be solved using structural equation modelling (SEM). This is a modelling technique which can handle a large number of endogenous and exogenous variables. Because of the multiple directions of causality that can be explored, SEM can help us to define the relationship between revealed preference data and stated preference data.},

	abstract = {In today's technology-assisted society, social interactions may be expressed through a variety of techno-communication channels, including online social networks, email and mobile phones (calls, text messages). Consequently, a clear grasp of human behavior through the diverse communication media is considered a key factor in understanding the formation of the today's information society. So far, all previous research on user communication behavior has focused on a sole communication activity. In this paper we move forward another step on this research path by performing a multidimensional study of human sociality as an expression of the use of mobile phones. The paper focuses on user temporal communication behavior in the interplay between the two complementary communication media, text messages and phone calls, that represent the bi-dimensional scenario of analysis. Our study provides a theoretical framework for analyzing multidimensional bursts as the most general burst category, that includes one-dimensional bursts as the simplest case, and offers empirical evidence of their nature by following the combined phone call/text message communication patterns of approximately one million people over three-month period. This quantitative approach enables the design of a generative model rooted in the three most significant features of the multidimensional burst - the number of dimensions, prevalence and interleaving degree - able to reproduce the main media usage attitude. The other findings of the paper include a novel multidimensional burst detection algorithm and an insight analysis of the human media selection process.},

Since the addition of geotagging information, Twitter has become a valuable source for the study of human dynamics. Its analysis is shedding new light not only on understanding human behavior but also on modeling the way people live and interact in their urban environments. In this paper, we evaluate the use of geolocated tweets as a complementary source of information for urban planning applications. Our contributions are focussed in two urban planing areas: (1) a technique to automatically determine land uses in a specific urban area based on tweeting patterns, and (2) a technique to automatically identify urban points of interest as places with high activity of tweets. We apply our techniques in Manhattan (NYC) using 49 days of geolocated tweets and validate them using land use and landmark information provided by various NYC departments. Our results indicate that geolocated tweets are a powerful and dynamic data source to characterize urban environments.},

Given today's abundance of crowd-generated digital traces on location-based social network (LBSN) platforms, an opportunity arises to grasp deeper semantic characterization of urban affordances beyond static representations found in traditional GIS systems. Complementing these perceptions of the city, travel surveys capture mobility dynamics of people with absolute trajectory recordings and explicit travel purposes. By marrying rich LBSN data with travel surveys, we ask if crowdsourced urban characteristics can be used to explain user behaviour when interacting with the city. Concretely, our objective is to model and infer the purpose of travel, or the activity at the destination of a trip, in daily life scenarios. To this end, we generate features to correspond to time, location, and demographics in order to construct a fused understanding of people's travel purposes. Using LBSN data to augment a travel survey of 87,600 trips by 10,372 people, we show that fusion of extracted features can achieve an interpersonal prediction accuracy of {\textgreater}75\% for 9 broad classes of travel purposes covering typical aspects of life. This represents an increase of nearly 20\% compared to without LBSN augmentation.},

Similarly, the share of the private mode of transport was found to be increasing, and a formal public transport system is absent in many of these cities. In the present study it was hypothesized that the changing socio -economic characteristics and the land use pattern were the major factors causing these changes. Land use pattern has been characterized using the intersection density, and the land use mix parameters such as Area Index. An attempt has been made to study the effect of land use and socioeconomic parameters on the choice of private/public and motorized/non-motorized modes. In both the cases, socioeconomic characteristics were found to be significantly influencing the utilities of the modes. In both the cases, parameter on land use mix and the intersection density were also found to be significant.

	abstract = {This paper aims to examine the relationship between urban form and personal daily trips between urban zones across Metropolitan Shiraz, Iran. To cope with collinearity nature of trip generation determinants and also multicollinearity in model estimation, component principal analysis (PCA) was employed to identify latent dimensions of trip generation. Then, a multiple regression model with continuous independent variables was developed to measure the effect of each individual variable on entire trips generated among urban zones. The explanatory variables included both physical characteristics of the metropolitan (land use diversity, density, suburbanization, connectivity, and accessibility to public transport), and socio-economic characteristics of trip makers (age, employment status, education, migration, property value) aggregated on the urban zones scale. The empirical findings, based on ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of 2006 data for 47 traffic area zones (TAZ) with total population over 1.1 million indicated that socio-economic characteristics were the most positive determinants of trip generation among the zones. On contrast, suburbanization (distance from central business district (CBD)) and distance from public transport facilities were negatively associated with the trip generation. However, other physical factors such as land use mix and network connectivity were found not important in influencing intra-zone trip generation, probably influencing inter-zone trip generation instead. In fact, improving local accessibility may reduce the need to intra-zonal travel, rather may also increase the tendency to travel within the neighborhood area.},

Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

We extract nationwide inter-urban movements in China from a check-in data set that covers half a million individuals within 370 cities to analyze the underlying patterns of trips and spatial interactions. By fitting the gravity model, we find that the observed spatial interactions are governed by a power law distance decay effect. The obtained gravity model also closely reproduces the exponential trip displacement distribution. The movement of an individual, however, may not obey the same distance decay effect, leading to an ecological fallacy. We also construct a spatial network where the edge weights denote the interaction strengths. The communities detected from the network are spatially cohesive and roughly consistent with province boundaries. We attribute this pattern to different distance decay parameters between intra-province and inter-province trips.},

We examine this large-scale data in order to explore three critical issues: (1) the inherent daily activity structure of individuals in a metropolitan area, (2) the variation of individual daily activities{\textemdash}how they grow and fade over time, and (3) clusters of individual behaviors and the revelation of their related socio-demographic information. We find that the population can be clustered into 8 and 7 representative groups according to their activities during weekdays and weekends, respectively. Our results enrich the traditional divisions consisting of only three groups (workers, students and non-workers) and provide clusters based on activities of different time of day. The generated clusters combined with social demographic information provide a new perspective for urban and transportation planning as well as for emergency response and spreading dynamics, by addressing when, where, and how individuals interact with places in metropolitan areas.},

This finding, which has implications for dynamics of spreading phenomena in social networks, agrees with results previously reported on other human activities.},

	abstract = {Uncertain ground conditions represent the primary source of risk in underground tunnel construction. However, this problem can be solved by developing an accurate, probabilistic description of the geology. This paper presents a general model for probability based determination of tunnel geology that can be used as a basis for developing more effective decision support systems for tunneling design and construction. The proposed model is based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and a neural network (NN). An approximate inference technique {\textendash} a Particle Filter (PF) Algorithm {\textendash} is used to simulate the geological parameters. This model overcomes the deficiencies of existing models by readily incorporating all available geologic information and updating geologic predictions based on observations given by the neural network. In order to validate the proposed model, the {\textquotedblleft}Drainage Water Tunnel Project{\textquotedblright} at Zhong-He, Taipei, Taiwan was used. The results showed that the Neural-HMM model provides high accuracy in geological prediction.},

	abstract = {With the large-scale adoption of GPS equipped mobile sensing devices, positional data generated by moving objects (e.g., vehicles, people, animals) are being easily collected. Such data are typically modeled as streams of spatio-temporal (x,y,t) points, called trajectories. In recent years trajectory management research has progressed significantly towards efficient storage and indexing techniques, as well as suitable knowledge discovery. These works focused on the geometric aspect of the raw mobility data. We are now witnessing a growing demand in several application sectors (e.g., from shipment tracking to geo-social networks) on understanding the semantic behavior of moving objects. Semantic behavior refers to the use of semantic abstractions of the raw mobility data, including not only geometric patterns but also knowledge extracted jointly from the mobility data and the underlying geographic and application domains information. The core contribution of this article lies in a semantic model and a computation and annotation platform for developing a semantic approach that progressively transforms the raw mobility data into semantic trajectories enriched with segmentations and annotations. We also analyze a number of experiments we did with semantic trajectories in different domains.},

	abstract = {Social media data are increasingly perceived as alternative sources to public attitude surveys because of the volume of available data that are time-stamped and (sometimes) precisely located. Such data can be mined to provide planners, marketers and researchers with useful information about activities and opinions across time and space. However, in their raw form, textual data are still difficult to analyse coherently and Twitter streams pose particular interpretive challenges because they are restricted to just 140 characters. This paper explores the use of an unsupervised learning algorithm to classify geo-tagged Tweets from Inner London recorded during typical weekdays throughout 2013 into a small number of groups, following extensive text cleaning techniques. Our classification identifies 20 distinctive and interpretive topic groupings, which represent key types of Tweets, from describing activities or informal conversations between users, to the use of check-in applets. Our motivation is to use the classification to demonstrate how the nature of the content posted on Twitter varies according to the characteristics of places and users. Topics and attitudes expressed through Tweets are found to vary substantially across Inner London, and by time of day. Some observed variations in behaviour on Twitter can be attributed to the inferred demographic and socio-economic characteristics of users, but place and local activities can also exert a considerable influence. Overall, the classification was found to provide a valuable framework for investigating the content and coverage of Twitter usage across Inner London.},

The tool uses data generated from mobile phones as a proxy to provide several insights with regards to the commuting patterns of the population within the bounds of a city. The three major components of the browser are the data warehouse, modules and algorithm, and the visualization interface. The modules and algorithm component utilizes Call Detail Records (CDRs) stored within the data warehouse to infer mobility patterns that are then communicated through the visualization interface. The modules and algorithm component consists of four modules: the spatial-temporal decomposition module, the home/work capturing module, the community detection module, and the flow estimation module. The visualization interface manages the output of each module to provide a comprehensive view of a city{\textquoteright}s mobility dynamics over varying time scales. A case study is presented on the city of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, where the browser was developed to better understand city mobility patterns.},

Our approach is evaluated on the data provided as part of the Nokia Mobile Data Challenge (MDC), focusing, in particular, on location labelling. We also present a set of tools for visualizing the MDC data, which were used to generate training data for storyline creation. Finally, we present a quantitative analysis of wifi data in a busy office setting, and present a novel model for wifi signals that more accurately matches the properties of signals in a natural environment.

	abstract = {Recognizing and classifying users' routine behavior patterns from sensor data has been a hot topic in pervasive computing. Its objective is to automatically discover recurrent routine patterns in a user's daily life by leveraging the multimodal data generated from wearable sensors such as mobile phones. This kind of knowledge can be utilized in many ways such as identifying similar users in terms of their behaviors, providing behavior contexts to enable advanced human-centered applications, etc. While numerous works have been done in this area, most of them rely on densely sampled mobile data collected from specially-programmed sensors that can "follow" people throughout the day. In this paper, we study how to achieve the same objective when the mobile data presented is much sparser, such as traditional mobile phone data where a user's location is reported only when he makes a call. Although a single user's mobile data is far from sufficient to reveal his characteristic behavior, we show that when exploiting a large number of users' mobile data in a principled collaborative way which facilitate similar users' data to complement each other, representative routine patterns can be revealed and each user can be characterized properly. Experiments on synthetic and real mobile phone data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, and also show our model's ability in predicting human activity using the patterns learned.},

You want to know all about the exciting sights, food outlets, and cultural venues that the locals frequent, in particular those that suit your personal interests. Even though there exist many mapping, local search, and travel assistance sites, they mostly provide popular and famous listings such as Statue of Liberty and Eiffel Tower, which are well-known places but may not suit your personal needs or interests. Therefore, there is a gap between what tourists want and what dominant tourism resources are providing. In this work, we seek to provide a solution to bridge this gap by exploiting the rich user-generated location contents in location-based social networks in order to offer tourists the most relevant and personalized local venue recommendations. In particular, we first propose a novel Bayesian approach to extract the social dimensions of people at different geographical regions to capture their latent local interests. We next mine the local interest communities in each geographical region. We then represent each local community using aggregated behaviors of community members. Finally, we correlate communities across different regions and generate venue recommendations to tourists via cross-region community matching. We have sampled a representative subset of check-ins from Foursquare and experimentally verified the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.},

Existing studies on this topic mainly treat such recommendations in a traditional manner{\textemdash}that is, they treat POIs as items and check-ins as ratings. However, users usually visit a place for reasons other than to simply say that they have visited. In this article, we propose an approach referred to as Urban POI-Walk (UPOI-Walk), which takes into account a user's social-triggered intentions (SI), preference-triggered intentions (PreI), and popularity-triggered intentions (PopI), to estimate the probability of a user checking-in to a POI. The core idea of UPOI-Walk involves building a HITS-based random walk on the normalized check-in network, thus supporting the prediction of POI properties related to each user's preferences. To achieve this goal, we define several user--POI graphs to capture the key properties of the check-in behavior motivated by user intentions. In our UPOI-Walk approach, we propose a new kind of random walk model{\textemdash}Dynamic HITS-based Random Walk{\textemdash}which comprehensively considers the relevance between POIs and users from different aspects. On the basis of similitude, we make an online recommendation as to the POI the user intends to visit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on urban POI recommendations that considers user check-in behavior motivated by SI, PreI, and PopI in location-based social network data. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations on two real datasets, the proposed UPOI-Walk is shown to deliver excellent performance.},

The former makes recommendations based on historical rating scores of items and the latter based on their rankings. Ranking-based CF has demonstrated advantages in recommendation accuracy, being able to capture the preference similarity between users even if their rating scores differ significantly. In this study, we propose VSRank, a novel framework that seeks accuracy improvement of ranking-based CF through adaptation of the vector space model. In VSRank, we consider each user as a document and his or her pairwise relative preferences as terms. We then use a novel degree-specialty weighting scheme resembling TF-IDF to weight the terms. Extensive experiments on benchmarks in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the promise of our approach.},

	abstract = {Providing better travel services for tourists is one of the important applications in urban computing. Though many recommender systems have been developed for enhancing the quality of travel service, most of them lack a systematic and open framework to dynamically incorporate multiple types of additional context information existing in the tourism domain, such as the travel area, season, and price of travel packages. To that end, in this article, we propose an open framework, the Objected-Oriented Recommender System (ORS), for the developers performing personalized travel package recommendations to tourists. This framework has the ability to import all the available additional context information to the travel package recommendation process in a cost-effective way. Specifically, the different types of additional information are extracted and uniformly represented as feature--value pairs. Then, we define the Object, which is the collection of the feature--value pairs. We propose two models that can be used in the ORS framework for extracting the implicit relationships among Objects. The Objected-Oriented Topic Model (OTM) can extract the topics conditioned on the intrinsic feature--value pairs of the Objects. The Objected-Oriented Bayesian Network (OBN) can effectively infer the cotravel probability of two tourists by calculating the co-occurrence time of feature--value pairs belonging to different kinds of Objects. Based on the relationships mined by OTM or OBN, the recommendation list is generated by the collaborative filtering method. Finally, we evaluate these two models and the ORS framework on real-world travel package data, and the experimental results show that the ORS framework is more flexible in terms of incorporating additional context information, and thus leads to better performances for travel package recommendations. Meanwhile, for feature selection in ORS, we define the feature information entropy, and the experimental results demonstrate that using features with lower entropies usually leads to better recommendation results.},

The performance of this module was evaluated on sentences from personal stories about life experiences.

Traditionally, the data available for traffic simulations come from a population census and dedicated road surveys that only partly cover shopping, leisure, or recreational trips. To account for the latter, the presented traffic modeling framework exploits the digital footprints of city inhabitants on services such as Twitter and Foursquare. We enriched the model with findings from our previous studies on geographical layout of communities in a country-wide mobile phone network to account for socially related journeys. These datasets were used to calibrate a variant of a radiation model of spatial choice, which we introduced in order to drive individuals{\textquoteright} decisions on trip destinations within an assigned daily activity plan. We observed that given the distribution of population, the workplace locations, a comprehensive set of urban facilities, and a list of typical activity sequences of city dwellers collected within a national travel survey, the developed microsimulation reproduces not only the journey statistics such as peak travel periods but also the traffic volumes at main road segments with surprising accuracy.},

Unlike existing approaches, our algorithm uses an ensemble of statistical and heuristic classifiers to predict locations and makes use of a geographic gazetteer dictionary to identify place-name entities. We find that a hierarchical classification approach, where time zone, state, or geographic region is predicted first and city is predicted next, can improve prediction accuracy. We have also analyzed movement variations of Twitter users, built a classifier to predict whether a user was travelling in a certain period of time, and use that to further improve the location detection accuracy. Experimental evidence suggests that our algorithm works well in practice and outperforms the best existing algorithms for predicting the home location of Twitter users.},

	abstract = {Location-based services allow users to perform geospatial recording actions, which facilitates the mining of the moving activities of human beings. This article proposes to recommend time-sensitive trip routes consisting of a sequence of locations with associated timestamps based on knowledge extracted from large-scale timestamped location sequence data (e.g., check-ins and GPS traces). We argue that a good route should consider (a) the popularity of places, (b) the visiting order of places, (c) the proper visiting time of each place, and (d) the proper transit time from one place to another. By devising a statistical model, we integrate these four factors into a route goodness function that aims to measure the quality of a route. Equipped with the route goodness, we recommend time-sensitive routes for two scenarios. The first is about constructing the route based on the user-specified source location with the starting time. The second is about composing the route between the specified source location and the destination location given a starting time. To handle these queries, we propose a search method, Guidance Search, which consists of a novel heuristic satisfaction function that guides the search toward the destination location and a backward checking mechanism to boost the effectiveness of the constructed route. Experiments on the Gowalla check-in datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on detecting real routes and performing cloze test of routes, comparing with other baseline methods. We also develop a system TripRouter as a real-time demo platform.},

	abstract = {Today, online social media outlets provide new and plentiful sources of data on social networks (SNs) and location-based social networks (LBSNs), i.e., geolocated evidence of connections between individuals. While SNs have been used to show how the magnitude of social connectivity decreases with distance, there are few examples of how to include SNs as layers in a GISystem. If SNs, and thus, interpersonal relationships, could be analyzed in a geographic information system (GIS) setting, we could better model how humans socialize, share information, and form social groups within the complex geographic landscape.Our goal is to facilitate a guide for analyzing SNs (as derived from online social media, telecommunications, surveys, etc.) within geographic space by combining the mature fields of social network analysis (SNA) and GISystems. First, we describe why modeling socialization in geographic space is essential for understanding human behavior. We then outline best practices and techniques for embedding SN nodes and edges in GISystems by introducing terms like {\textquoteleft}social flow{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}anthrospace{\textquoteright}, and categorizations for data and spatial aggregation types. Finally, we explore case study vignettes of SNA within GISystems from diverse regions located in Bolivia, China, C{\^o}te d{\textquoteright}Ivoire, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States, using concepts such as geolocated dyads, ego{\textendash}alter relationships, node feature roles, modularity, and network transitivity.},

Peaks in the number of aurora-related tweets are found to frequently coincide with geomagnetic disturbances (detection rate of 91\%). Additionally, the number of daily aurora-related tweets is found to strongly correlate with several auroral strength proxies (ravg?0.7). An examination is made of the bias for location and time of day within Twitter data, and a first-order correction of these effects is presented. Overall, the results suggest that Twitter can provide both specific details about an individual aurora and accurate real-time indication of when, and even from where, an aurora is visible.},

Such areas often have high exposure to the general public, and receive a large number of visits. As a result, urban AOI can reveal useful information for city planners, transportation analysts, and location-based service providers to plan new business, extend existing infrastructure, and so forth. Urban AOI exist in people's perception and are defined by behaviors. However, such perception was rarely captured until the Social Web information technology revolution. Social media data record the interactions between users and their surrounding environment, and thus have the potential to uncover interesting urban areas and their underlying spatiotemporal dynamics. This paper presents a coherent framework for extracting and understanding urban AOI based on geotagged photos. Six different cities from six different countries have been selected for this study, and Flickr photo data covering these cities in the past ten years (2004{\textendash}2014) have been retrieved. We identify AOI using DBSCAN clustering algorithm, understand AOI by extracting distinctive textual tags and preferable photos, and discuss the spatiotemporal dynamics as well as some insights derived from the AOI. An interactive prototype has also been implemented as a proof-of-concept. While Flickr data have been used in this study, the presented framework can also be applied to other geotagged photos.},

Blau defines social structure via social {\textquotedblleft}parameters{\textquotedblright} (constraints).

One of Blau{\textquoteright}s most important hypotheses resulting from this work was that the consolidation of parameters could lead to isolated social groups. For example, the consolidation of race and income might lead to segregation. In the present work, we use Foursquare data from New York City to explore evidence of homogeneity along certain social parameters and consolidation that breeds social isolation in communities of locations checked in to by similar users. More specifically, we first test the extent to which communities detected via Latent Dirichlet Allocation are homogenous across a set of four social constraints{\textemdash}racial homophily, income homophily, personal interest homophily and physical space. Using a bootstrapping approach, we find that 14 (of 20) communities are statistically, and all but one qualitatively, homogenous along one of these social constraints, showing the relevance of Blau{\textquoteright}s latent space model in venue communities determined via user check-in behavior. We then consider the extent to which communities with consolidated parameters, those homogenous on more than one parameter, represent socially isolated populations. We find communities homogenous on multiple parameters, including a homosexual community and a {\textquotedblleft}hipster{\textquotedblright} community, that show support for Blau{\textquoteright}s hypothesis that consolidation breeds social isolation. We consider these results in the context of mediated communication, in particular in the context of self-representation on social media.},

Much of this information now contains some form of geographical content because of the proliferation of location-aware devices, thus fostering the emergence of geosocial media {\textendash} a new type of user-generated geospatial information. Through geosocial media we are able, for the first time, to observe human activities in scales and resolutions that were so far unavailable. Furthermore, the wide spectrum of social media data and service types provides a multitude of perspectives on real-world activities and happenings, thus opening new frontiers in geosocial knowledge discovery. However, gleaning knowledge from geosocial media is a challenging task, as they tend to be unstructured and thematically diverse. To address these challenges, this article presents a system prototype for harvesting, processing, modeling, and integrating heterogeneous social media feeds towards the generation of geosocial knowledge. Our article addresses primarily two key components of this system prototype: a novel data model for heterogeneous social media feeds and a corresponding general system architecture. We present these key components and demonstrate their implementation in our system prototype, GeoSocial Gauge.},

Using cell phone location data, as well as data from two online location-based social networks, we aim to understand what basic laws govern human motion and dynamics. We find that humans experience a combination of periodic movement that is geographically limited and seemingly random jumps correlated with their social networks. Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more influenced by social network ties. We show that social relationships can explain about 10\% to 30\% of all human movement, while periodic behavior explains 50\% to 70\%. Based on our findings, we develop a model of human mobility that combines periodic short range movements with travel due to the social network structure. We show that our model reliably predicts the locations and dynamics of future human movement and gives an order of magnitude better performance than present models of human mobility.},

	abstract = {The institutional and financial circumstances at many transit agencies significantly constrain the bus planning process. Long-term planning focuses on major infrastructure projects, while short-term planning focuses on scheduling and minor service adjustments. Medium-range bus planning is given limited attention in many agencies, especially those with significant capacity constraints. Recent research has developed a new method of assembling data that has the potential to be very useful to service planners: origin, destination, and interchange inference (ODX), which uses farecard and vehicle location data to provide a previously unavailable level of geographically precise disaggregate data on passengers' linked trips. This research develops a framework for using ODX for medium- to long-range bus planning. It proposes a service planning process that targets limited resources at the areas that need them most. It develops tools and methods for using ODX data to design and evaluate realistic, practical, and incremental service changes to improve accessibility to key parts of the agency's service area. The process has five phases: identification of target locations, analysis of those locations, development of proposed service changes, evaluation of those proposals, and post-implementation review. Several case studies are presented using data from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), the transit agency for the Boston region. First, three target locations in the MBTA service area are analyzed. Service changes that would improve access to each of these locations are proposed and evaluated, including additional frequency on an existing route, the creation of a new route, and extensions of two existing routes. ODX and related data are used to analyze each proposal in detail in a process that can be replicated by other agencies with similar data.},

	abstract = {By inferring individual passengers' origins, destinations, and transfers using automatically collected transit data, transit providers can obtain and analyze larger volumes of information, with more accuracy, and at more frequent intervals than are available through traditional origin-destination (OD) surveys. Automatic OD inference can be an input into the analysis and reporting of agencies' social goals, such as the provision of equitable service regardless of race, national origin, or ethnicity, which is federally required in the USA by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The methodology prescribed in the Title VI regulation, however, has not adapted to the opportunity to supplement supply metrics with passenger-centric demand metrics through the availability of OD data. The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate a preliminary methodology to link automatically inferred OD information from regular transit users to the demographic data of public transit commuters from the US Census's American Community Survey, and to examine variation in passenger-centric metrics such as journey time and speed. This study infers origins and destinations in the context of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). From a sample month of these data, an example of a passenger-centric analysis is performed by comparing travel times and speeds of trips with origins in areas home to predominantly Black or African American transit commuters to travel times and speeds of trips with origins in areas home to predominantly White transit commuters. Commuters from predominantly Black or African American census tracts are found to have longer travel times and slower speeds relative to commuters from tracts where commuters are predominantly White. Differences are within agency specified margins, but are significant, in particular for journeys involving bus transfers. Short-term solutions such as through-routing of important bus routes and increasing reliability of bus departures at terminals and long-term solutions such as faster, more frequent Diesel Multiple Unit rail service are proposed and evaluated to mitigate these differences.},

	abstract = {Urban computing fuses computer science with other fields, such as transportation, in the context of urban spaces by connecting ubiquitous sensing technologies, analytical models and visualizations to solve challenging problems in urban environment and operation systems. This paper focuses on Call Detail Records, one widely collected opportunistic sensing data source for billing purposes, to understand presence patterns, develop mobility prediction methods and reduce traffic congestions with location recommendations. Understanding human mobility and presence patterns at locations are the building blocks for behavior prediction, service design and system improvements. In the first part, this thesis focuses on 1) understanding presence patterns at user locations with a proposed metric Normalized Hourly Presence, 2) extracting common presence patterns across the population with Principal Component Analysis; 3) and infer home and workplaces using K-means Clustering and Fuzzy C-means Clustering. The proposed method was implemented on MIT Reality Mining data, by which we demonstrate that with inference rates of 56\% and 82\%, the method can improve 79\% and 34\% in accuracy respectively in home and workplace inference comparing to the baseline model. In addition, it was implemented on the CDR data collected in a crowded city in China to prove its scalability and applicability in real-world applications. With Fuzzy C-means Clustering, we could flexibly trade-off between inference rate and accuracy to understand the interplay between the two and apply it for various purposes. With an understanding of mobility patterns, the next crucial foundation in urban computing is mobility prediction, enabling transportation practitioners to take actions beforehand and commercial organizations to send location-based advertisements, etc. Specifically, this paper focuses on next-location prediction from Call Detail Records. Mobility traces was analogized to language models, mapping cell towers to words and individual location traces to sentences. Recurrent Neural Network is a successful tool in natural language processing, which is applied in mobility prediction due to its acceptance of sequential input, variable input length and ability to learn the 'meaning' of cell towers. By implementing the method on Call Detail Records collected in Andorra, we show that the method improved more than 40\% over the baseline model, with 67\% and 78\% accuracy in next location at cell tower and merged cell tower level respectively. The 'meanings' of the cell tower could also be inferred, the same as learning the meanings of words in sentences, from the embedding layer of Recurrent Neural Network. The last project aims at tackling the challenge of severe traffic congestions with location recommendations. The availability of large-scale longitudinal geolocation data, such as Call Detail Records, offers planners and service providers an unprecedented opportunity to understand location preferences and alleviate traffic congestions. Location recommendation is a potential tool to achieve these two objectives. Previous research on location recommendations has focused on automatically and accurately inferring users' preferences, while little attention has been devoted to the constraints of service capacity. The ignorance may lead to congestion and long waiting time. We argue that Call Detail Records could help planners and authorities make interventions by providing personalized recommendations given the comprehensive urban-wide picture of historical behaviors and preferences. In this research, we propose a method to make location recommendations for system efficiency, defined as maximizing satisfactions toward recommendations subject to capacity constraints, exploiting travelers' choice flexibilities. We infer implicit location preferences based on sparse and passively-collected Call Detail Records. We then formulate an optimization model the defined system efficiency. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we implement the method in Andorra, a small European country heavily relying on tourism. By extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the method can reduce the travel time increased by congestion during peak hour from 11.73 minutes to 5.6 minutes with idealized trips under full compliance rates. We show that the average travel time increased by congestion is 6.17, 6.98, 8.37 and 10.98 minutes with 80\%, 60\%, 40\% and 20\% compliance rates. Overall, our results indicate that Call Detail Records can be used to make locations recommendation while reduce traffic congestion for system efficiency. The proposed method can be applied to other large-scale location traces and extended to other location or events recommendation applications.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, I present a cross-cultural study on human's trip length distribution and how it might be influenced by regional socio-economic factors, such as population density, income and unemployment rate. Mobile phone records contain very detailed calling information of the spatiotemporal localization of hundreds of thousands of users, which can be used as proxies for human trips. The traveling behaviors of 24 autonomous regions in San Francisco (5 regions), Dominican Republic (3 regions) and a European country (16 regions) are studied through these rich mobile phone data sets. We found that people in different regions have very heterogeneous aggregate traveling patterns (trip length distribution) which can be generally grouped into four distinct families. The result of Self-organizing map shows that the trip length distribution has a certain degree of correlation to population density, which sparks our interests to conduct a thorough research on factors such as population density and income that can potentially influence the trip length distribution and human's traveling behavior. Using a double exponential function to fit the radius of gyration distribution (i.e. a proxy to the trip length distribution), we are able to characterize human's traveling behavior with four parameters. By applying principle component analysis, the parameter space is transformed orthogonally and two principal components which contribute most to the variance of sample set are extracted. We tempted to find the regression relationship between population density and each of the components. However, the R{\texttwosuperior} is not enough high for estimation purposes. With the extensive information source regarding household income, median age, unemployment rate, we were able to conduct a multiple regression analysis in San Francisco Bay area. Using radius of gyration as regressand, population density, income, age, and unemployment rate as regressors, we found the R{\texttwosuperior} is over 30\%, which is sufficiently good for cross-sectional data analysis. Additionally, the significant estimated coefficients indicate that people living in wealthier and unpopulated areas tend to travel more frequently and make long distance trips. Furthermore, descriptive comments are provided for the connection between parameters in the fitting function and population density and income.},

	abstract = {Our current digital age is characterized by the shift from traditional industry to an economy based on the information computerization. The sweeping changes brought about by digital computing have provided new data sources for transportation modeling. In this thesis, two mainstream trends in utilizing digital traces in transportation modeling are explored. The first approach is to incorporate mobile phone records and digital map point of interests into commuting flow prediction models such as the gravity model and the radiation model. An extension to the radiation model is proposed to adjust to the different degrees of homogeneity of opportunities when the scale of the study region changes. The density of the point of interests is a suitable proxy for commuting flow attraction rates at all the scales. Moreover, the parameter a in the extension to the radiation model is predictable given the size of the study region. When traditional data sources are not available, mobile phone records is shown to be an ideal alternative. Home and work locations can be inferred at individual level and then aggregated to show its equivalence to the census data. This method is applied to Rwanda, Dominican Republic and Portugal. The second approach is using low-frequency bus GPS records to evaluate transit service. The analysis under such data scarcity requires careful data handling. This thesis demonstrates that how the data pre-processing procedure, namely map-matching and kernel density estimation, step by step turns the raw GPS data into information for service evaluation. Bus service quality is analyzed by measuring statistics of headway and in-vehicle travel time. The headway analysis helps to identify bottlenecks caused by the road network layout and passenger volumes while the comparison of peak vs. off-peak hour travel speed helps to identify bottlenecks caused by traffic conditions. To sum up, the thesis explores new digital data sources and methods in transportation modeling. The purpose is to provide analysis procedures that are of lower costs, higher accuracy and are readily applicable to different countries in the world.},

	abstract = {Rapid urbanization and technological innovations sparked the generation of massive volumes of data that is continually improving in resolution. In particular, mobile phones, having reached penetration levels above 97\% in Europe and Americas according to the World Bank, transformed into passive sensors of urban mobility by signaling movement at the individual level. The data generated by these devices has a wide range of applications concerning how people and cities interact through the infrastructure. This thesis presents new analysis tools that utilize large geolocated datasets to provide new insights towards human mobility, road networks, congestion, and energy. In the first part of this work, we analyze the emergence of vehicular congestion in an urban road network through the use of a simple traffic flow model. We show that spatial constraints and the topology of the road network are determinant factors that shape the nature of the city's phase transition to a congested state. In the second part, we outline a methodology that processes raw geolocated data to extract aggregate mobility information that is comparable to local surveys and existing origin-destination matrices for five different metropolitan areas. Next, we analyze how the unique congestion fingerprint of a city is produced through the combination of travel demand, population density, road supply and route choice. We evaluate the potential of implementing socially aware routing solutions for congestion alleviation, and assess the implications of such solutions. Finally, we couple urban travel demand with energy demand of electric vehicles, and present their relationship while exploring the potential benefits of optimized arrival hour and charging timeshifts.},

	abstract = {The study of dynamic processes that take place on heterogeneous networks is essential to better understand, forecast, and manage human activities in an increasingly connected world. In this Thesis, we elucidate the role of the network topology as well as the nature of the underlying processes in a variety of phenomena rooted on highly connected network systems. We use real world applications as the motivation to address three distinct questions. The first question is: how is the spread of infectious diseases at the global scale mediated by long-range human travel? We show that network topology, geography, traffic structure and individual mobility patterns are all essential for accurate predictions of disease spreading. Specifically, we study contagion dynamics through the air transportation network by means of a stochastic agent-tracking model that accounts for the spatial distribution of airports, detailed air traffic and the correlated nature of mobility patterns and waiting-time distributions of individual agents. We formulate a metric of influential spreading-the geographic spreading centrality-which provides an accurate measure of the early-time spreading power of individual nodes. The second question is: what is the effect of human behavioral changes in their mobility patterns on the dynamics of contagion through transportation networks? We address this question by developing a model of awareness coupled to disease spreading through mobility networks, where we implement two kinds of behavioral changes: selfish and policy-driven. In analogy with the concept of price of anarchy in transportation networks subject to congestion, we show that maximizing individual utility leads to a loss of welfare for the social group, measured here by the size of the outbreak. The third question is: what are the mechanisms behind the formation of cell assemblies in neural activity networks? From a neuroscience perspective: How can one explain functional compartmentalization in a globally-connected brain? Here we show that simple mechanisms of neural interaction allow for the emergence of robust cell assemblies through self-organization. We demonstrate the properties of such neural network processes with a minimal-ingredients model of excitation and inhibition between neurons that leads to self-organization of neural activity into local quantized states, even though the underlying network system is globally connected.},

Most of such complex networks are inherently dynamic, with new vertices and links appearing while some old ones disappear. Until recently, the dynamics of these networks was less studied and there is a strong need for dynamic network models in order to sustain protocol performance evaluations and fundamental analyzes in all the research domains listed above.

We propose in this paper a novel framework for the study of dynamic mobility networks. We address the characterization of dynamics by proposing an in-depth description and analysis of two real-world data sets. We show in particular that links creation and deletion processes are independent of other graph properties and that such networks exhibit a large number of possible configurations, from sparse to dense. From those observations, we propose simple yet very accurate models that allow generate random mobility graphs with similar temporal behavior as the one observed in experimental data.},

Indeed, a large number of environmental epidemiological studies have quantified the health impacts of population exposure to pollution. In previous studies, exposure estimates at the population level have not considered spatially- and temporally varying populations present in study regions. Therefore, in the first study of it is kind, we use measured population activity patterns representing several million people to evaluate population-weighted exposure to air pollution on a city-wide scale. Mobile and wireless devices yield information about where and when people are present, thus collective activity patterns were determined using counts of connections to the cellular network. Population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 in New York City (NYC), herein termed {\textquotedblleft}Active Population Exposure{\textquotedblright} was evaluated using population activity patterns and spatiotemporal PM2.5 concentration levels, and compared to {\textquotedblleft}Home Population Exposure{\textquotedblright}, which assumed a static population distribution as per Census data. Areas of relatively higher population-weighted exposures were concentrated in different districts within NYC in both scenarios. These were more centralized for the {\textquotedblleft}Active Population Exposure{\textquotedblright} scenario. Population-weighted exposure computed in each district of NYC for the {\textquotedblleft}Active{\textquotedblright} scenario were found to be statistically significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) different to the {\textquotedblleft}Home{\textquotedblright} scenario for most districts. In investigating the temporal variability of the {\textquotedblleft}Active{\textquotedblright} population-weighted exposures determined in districts, these were found to be significantly different (p {\textless} 0.05) during the daytime and the nighttime. Evaluating population exposure to air pollution using spatiotemporal population mobility patterns warrants consideration in future environmental epidemiological studies linking air quality and human health.},

	abstract = {Social media applications are widely deployed in mobile platforms equipped with built-in GPS tracking devices, and these devices have led to an unprecedented collection of geolocated data (geo-tags). Geo-tags, along with place names, offer new opportunities to explore the trajectory and mobility patterns of social media users. However, trajectory data captured by social media are sparsely and irregularly spaced and therefore have varying degrees of resolution in both space and time. Previous studies on next location prediction are mostly applicable for detecting the upcoming location of a moving object using dense GPS trajectories where locations are recorded at regular time intervals (e.g., 1 minute). Additionally, point features are commonly used to represent the locations of visits, but using point features cannot capture the variability of human mobility. This article introduces a new methodology to predict an individual{\textquoteright}s next location based on sparse footprints accumulated over a long time period using social networks, and uses polygons to represent the location corresponding to the physical activity area of individuals. First, the density-based spatial clustering algorithm is employed to discover the most representative activity zones that an individual frequently visits on a daily basis, and a polygon-based region is then derived for each representative activity zone. A sparse mobility Markov chain model considering both the movements and online behaviors of the social media user is trained and used to predict the user{\textquoteright}s next location. Initial experiments with a group of Washington DC Twitter users demonstrate that the proposed methodology successfully discovers the activity regions and predicts the user{\textquoteright}s next location with accuracy approaching 78.94\%.},

Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

	abstract = {Identifying changes in the spatial structure of cities is a prerequisite for the development and validation of adequate planning strategies. Nevertheless, current methods of measurement are becoming ever more challenged by the highly diverse and intertwined ways of how people actually make use of urban space. Here, we propose a new quantitative measure for the centrality of locations, taking into account not only the numbers of people attracted to different locations, but also the diversity of the activities they are engaged in. This {\textquoteleft}centrality index{\textquoteright} allows for the identification of functional urban centres and for a systematic tracking of their relative importance over time, thus contributing to our understanding of polycentricity. We demonstrate the proposed index using travel survey data in Singapore for different years between 1997 and 2012. It is shown that, on the one hand, the city-state has been developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form that compares rather closely with the official urban development plan. On the other hand, however, the downtown core has strongly gained in its importance, and this can be partly attributed to the recent extension of the public transit system.},

	abstract = {Map generalization is a process of producing maps at different levels of detail by retaining essential properties of the underlying geographic space. In this article, we explore how the map generalization process can be guided by the underlying scaling of geographic space. The scaling of geographic space refers to the fact that in a geographic space, small things are far more common than large ones. In the corresponding rank-size distribution, this scaling property is characterized by a heavy-tailed plot such as a power law, lognormal, or exponential function. In essence, any heavy-tailed distribution consists of the head of the distribution (with a low percentage of vital or large things) and the tail of the distribution (with a high percentage of trivial or small things). Importantly, the low and high percentages constitute an imbalanced contrast, e.g., 20 versus 80. We suggest that the purpose of map generalization is to retain the objects in the head and to eliminate or aggregate those in the tail. We applied this selection rule to three generalization experiments and found that the scaling of geographic space indeed underlies map generalization. We further relate the universal rule to T{\"o}pfer's radical law (or trained cartographers' decision making in general) and illustrate several advantages of the universal rule.},

	abstract = {The dynamic spatial redistribution of individuals is a key driving force of various spatiotemporal phenomena on geographical scales. It can synchronize populations of interacting species, stabilize them, and diversify gene pools. Human travel, for example, is responsible for the geographical spread of human infectious disease. In the light of increasing international trade, intensified human mobility and the imminent threat of an influenza A epidemic, the knowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is of fundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of these properties on geographical scales remains elusive, and the assumption that humans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid and quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the circulation of bank notes in the United States. Using a comprehensive data set of over a million individual displacements, we find that dispersal is anomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays as a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of scale-free random walks known as L{\'e}vy flights. Second, the probability of remaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by algebraically long tails that attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show that human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many spatiotemporal scales by a two-parameter continuous-time random walk model to a surprising accuracy, and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an ambivalent and effectively superdiffusive process.},

	abstract = {Human mobility patterns can provide valuable information in understanding the impact of human behavioral regularities in urban systems, usually with a specific focus on traffic prediction, public health or urban planning. While existing studies on human movement have placed huge emphasis on spatial location to predict where people go next, the time dimension component is usually being treated with oversimplification or even being neglected. Time dimension is crucial to understanding and detecting human activity changes, which play a negative role in prediction and thus may affect the predictive accuracy. This study aims to predict human movement from a spatio-temporal perspective by taking into account the impact of activity changes. We analyze and define changes of human activity and propose an algorithm to detect such changes, based on which a Markov chain model is used to predict human movement. The Microsoft GeoLife dataset is used to test our methodology, and the data of two selected users is used to evaluate the performance of the prediction. We compare the predictive accuracy (R2) derived from the data with and without implementing the activity change detection. The results show that the R2 is improved from 0.295 to 0.762 for the user with obvious activity changes and from 0.965 to 0.971 for the user without obvious activity changes. The method proposed by this study improves the accuracy in analyzing and predicting human movement and lays the foundation for related urban studies.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present three classes of methods to extract information from triangulated mobile phone signals, and describe applications with different goals in spatiotemporal analysis and urban modeling. Our first challenge is to relate extracted information from phone records (i.e., a set of time-stamped coordinates estimated from signal strengths) with destinations by each of the million anonymous users. By demonstrating a method that converts phone signals into small grid cell destinations, we present a framework that bridges triangulated mobile phone data with previously established findings obtained from data at more coarse-grained resolutions (such as at the cell tower or census tract levels). In particular, this method allows us to relate daily mobility networks, called motifs here, with trip chains extracted from travel diary surveys. Compared with existing travel demand models mainly relying on expensive and less-frequent travel survey data, this method represents an advantage for applying ubiquitous mobile phone data to urban and transportation modeling applications. Second, we present a method that takes advantage of the high spatial resolution of the triangulated phone data to infer trip purposes by examining semantic-enriched land uses surrounding destinations in individual's motifs. In the final section, we discuss a portable computational architecture that allows us to manage and analyze mobile phone data in geospatial databases, and to map mobile phone trips onto spatial networks such that further analysis about flows and network performances can be done. The combination of these three methods demonstrate the state-of-the-art algorithms that can be adapted to triangulated mobile phone data for the context of urban computing and modeling applications.},

The actual OD matrices are derived by scaling up these node-to-node transient OD matrices. An optimization based approach, in conjunction with a microscopic traffic simulation platform, is used to determine the scaling factors that result best matches with the observed traffic counts.

In this chapter, two issues are addressed: (1) location sampling aiming at decreasing computation time without losing useful information on the one hand and to eliminate data considered as noise in the other hand and (2) users sampling whose goal is to select users having relevant information. For the first issue two measures allowing eliminating redundant information and ping-pong positions are proposed. The second issue requires the definition of a set of measures allowing estimating mobile phone data quality. New methods to qualify mobile phone data at local and global level are proposed. The methods are tested on one-day mobile phone data coming from technical mobile network probes.},

First, it constitutes the basis for analyzing activity patterns, for instance by correlating the derived classification with spatial and/or socio-economic variables. Secondly, the underlying mechanisms can be used to assess the degree of correspondence between observed activity patterns and activity patterns predicted by some activity-based model of transport demand. Traditionally, conventional Euclidean distance measures have been used for the comparison of activity patterns. Consequently, the sequence information embedded in activity patterns has not been explicitly considered when comparing activity patterns. More recently, sequence alignment methods have been proposed. Although these methods have some advantages, they are uni-dimensional and hence cannot incorporate the interdependencies between attributes. This paper therefore proposes a multidimensional sequence alignment method to measure differences in both sequential and interdependency information embedded in activity patterns.},

This paper compares observational data from mobile phones with standard self-report survey data. We find that the information from these two data sources is overlapping but distinct. For example, self-reports of physical proximity deviate from mobile phone records depending on the recency and salience of the interactions. We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 95\% of friendships based on the observational data alone, where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns in their physical proximity and calling patterns. These behavioral patterns, in turn, allow the prediction of individual-level outcomes such as job satisfaction.},

It also takes into account the effects of the pedestrian's previous status. A promotional experiment in a major shopping mall demonstrated that the highest prediction accuracy of the MMM method is 74.4\%. In comparison with methods based on a Markov-chain model (MM) and a hidden-Markov model (HMM) (i.e., prediction rates of about 45\% and 2\%, respectively), the proposed MMM-based prediction method is substantially more accurate. This pedestrian-movement prediction based on MMM using tracking data will make it possible to provide so-called "adaptive mobile services" with proactive functions.},

In a nutshell, we extend a mobility model called Mobility Markov Chain (MMC) in order to incorporate the n previous visited locations and we develop a novel algorithm for next location prediction based on this mobility model that we coined as n-MMC. The evaluation of the efficiency of our algorithm on three different datasets demonstrates an accuracy for the prediction of the next location in the range of 70\% to 95\% as soon as n = 2.},

Tasks such as the prediction of human movement can be addressed through the usage of these data, in turn offering support for more advanced applications, such as adaptive mobile services with proactive context-based functions. This paper presents an hybrid method for predicting human mobility on the basis of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The proposed approach clusters location histories according to their characteristics, and latter trains an HMM for each cluster. The usage of HMMs allows us to account with location characteristics as unobservable parameters, and also to account with the effects of each individual's previous actions. We report on a series of experiments with a real-world location history dataset from the GeoLife project, showing that a prediction accuracy of 13.85\% can be achieved when considering regions of roughly 1280 squared meters.},

Examining the spatial characteristics of daily household activity-travel behavior holds important implications for understanding and addressing urban transportation issues. Research of this sort can inform development of urban land use policy that encourages the use of local opportunities, potentially leading to reduced motorized travel. This article examines the potential household activity-travel response to a planned metropolitan polycentric hierarchy of activity centers. Behavioral observations have been drawn from an activity-travel survey conducted in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area during the mid-1990s. Evidence presented from exploratory analysis indicates an urban/suburban differential, with less daily travel and smaller activity spaces for urban households. Investigation of the travel reduction potential of the proposed land-use strategy suggests that location effects could be offset by adjustments to household sociodemographic and mobility characteristics.},

This phenomenon is known as volunteered geographic information (VGI). During the past decade VGI has been used as a data source supporting a wide range of services, such as environmental monitoring, events reporting, human movement analysis, disaster management, etc. However, these volunteer-contributed data also come with varying quality. Reasons for this are: data is produced by heterogeneous contributors, using various technologies and tools, having different level of details and precision, serving heterogeneous purposes, and a lack of gatekeepers. Crowd-sourcing, social, and geographic approaches have been proposed and later followed to develop appropriate methods to assess the quality measures and indicators of VGI. In this article, we review various quality measures and indicators for selected types of VGI and existing quality assessment methods. As an outcome, the article presents a classification of VGI with current methods utilized to assess the quality of selected types of VGI. Through these findings, we introduce data mining as an additional approach for quality handling in VGI.},

Often, the researcher is forced to decompose activity-travel patterns into their component dimensions and focus only on one or two dimensions at a time, or to treat them as a multidimensional whole using multivariate methods to derive generalized activity-travel patterns. This paper describes several GIS-based three-dimensional (3D) geovisualization methods for dealing with the spatial and temporal dimensions of human activity-travel patterns at the same time while avoiding the interpretative complexity of multivariate pattern generalization or recognition methods. These methods are operationalized using interactive 3D GIS techniques and a travel diary data set collected in the Portland (Oregon) metropolitan region. The study demonstrates several advantages in using these methods. First, significance of the temporal dimension and its interaction with the spatial dimension in structuring the daily space-time trajectories of individuals can be clearly revealed. Second, they are effective tools for the exploratory analysis of activity diary data that can lead to more focused analysis in later stages of a study. They can also help the formulation of more realistic computational or behavioral travel models.},

	abstract = {The pervasive use of new mobile devices has allowed a better characterization in space and time of human concentrations and mobility in general. Besides its theoretical interest, describing mobility is of great importance for a number of practical applications ranging from the forecast of disease spreading to the design of new spaces in urban environments. While classical data sources, such as surveys or census, have a limited level of geographical resolution (e.g., districts, municipalities, counties are typically used) or are restricted to generic workdays or weekends, the data coming from mobile devices can be precisely located both in time and space. Most previous works have used a single data source to study human mobility patterns. Here we perform instead a cross-check analysis by comparing results obtained with data collected from three different sources: Twitter, census, and cell phones. The analysis is focused on the urban areas of Barcelona and Madrid, for which data of the three types is available. We assess the correlation between the datasets on different aspects: the spatial distribution of people concentration, the temporal evolution of people density, and the mobility patterns of individuals. Our results show that the three data sources are providing comparable information. Even though the representativeness of Twitter geolocated data is lower than that of mobile phone and census data, the correlations between the population density profiles and mobility patterns detected by the three datasets are close to one in a grid with cells of 2{\texttimes}2 and 1{\texttimes}1 square kilometers. This level of correlation supports the feasibility of interchanging the three data sources at the spatio-temporal scales considered.},

Here we apply a functional network approach to determine land use patterns from mobile phone records. The versatility of the method allows us to run a systematic comparison between Spanish cities of various sizes. The method detects four major land use types that correspond to different temporal patterns. The proportion of these types, their spatial organization and scaling show a strong similarity between all cities that breaks down at a very local scale, where land use mixing is specific to each urban area. Finally, we introduce a model inspired by Schelling's segregation, able to explain and reproduce these results with simple interaction rules between different land uses.},

Although geo-location data has the potential to infer multi-day patterns of individual activities, appropriate methodological approaches are needed. This paper presents a technique to analyze large-scale geo-location data from social media to infer individual activity patterns. A data-driven modeling approach, based on topic modeling, is proposed to classify patterns in individual activity choices. The model provides an activity generation mechanism which when combined with the data from traditional surveys is potentially a useful component of an activity-travel simulator. Using the model, aggregate patterns of users{\textquoteright} weekly activities are extracted from the data. The model is extended to also find user-specific activity patterns. We extend the model to account for missing activities (a major limitation of social media data) and demonstrate how information from activity-based diaries can be complemented with longitudinal geo-location information. This work provides foundational tools that can be used when geo-location data is available to predict disaggregate activity patterns.},

Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities.

Yet, these models typically consider only a single kind of data source, such as data from mobile calls or location data obtained from GPS and web applications. Thus, the robustness and effectiveness of such data-driven models from the literature remain unknown when using heterogeneous types of data. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel family of data-driven models, called MobHet, to predict human mobility using heterogeneous data sources. Our proposal is designed to use a combination of features capturing the popularity of a region, the frequency of transitions between regions, and the contacts of a user, which can be extracted from data obtained from various sources, both separately and conjointly. We evaluate the MobHet models, comparing them among themselves and with two single-source data-driven models, namely SMOOTH and Leap Graph, while considering different scenarios with single as well as multiple data sources. Our experimental results show that our best MobHet model produces results that are better than or at least comparable to the best baseline in all considered scenarios, unlike the previous models whose performance is very dependent on the particular type of data used. Our results thus attest the robustness of our proposed solution to the use of heterogeneous data sources in predicting human mobility.},

The studies show how the human genome quickly responds to new conditions in subtle but meaningful ways. One study showed continued selection for taller stature, blond hair, and blue eyes in the past 2000 years. The other examined how allele frequencies can change within a lifetime.

In 2011, it adopted a Greenest City Action Plan that has made it a prominent pioneer in urban greening, including efforts to transform raw sewage and food waste into energy, and to coax residents to use less water and leave their cars to walk, bike, or ride public transport. And it isn't the only metropolis setting formidable targets. Around the world, urban leaders are embarking on an array of efforts to reduce the strain that cities place on the environment. Although cities are often seen as a source of environmental problems, many analysts argue they are also key to solving them; large urban populations, for instance, can use far less energy per capita than rural or suburban residents{\textemdash}if the right policies and infrastructure are in place. But time is short: Experts say how cities handle rapid urbanization in coming decades will be critical to protecting biodiversity and human health, as well as combatting climate change. Vancouver has taken the urgency to heart. Despite some successes, however, researchers say the city's experience illustrates the sobering limits that cities face in acting on their own to reduce environmental impacts, given the complexities of national politics and a globalized economy.

In February, national authorities adopted new urbanization guidelines that should, over time, lead to more compact cities with denser networks of narrow streets, more pedestrian and cycling lanes, better public transport, mixed-use zoning, and more green space. Planners and developers don't have to look outside China for examples to follow. Many neighborhoods within China's major cities provide home-grown examples of urbanization done right.

Today, more than half of us live in cities, surrounded by multitudes of people we'll never meet. This radical change happened in an evolutionary eye blink: We navigate our modern world with Paleolithic brains. In the traditional view, agriculture was the crucial innovation that paved the way for cities. But overcoming food constraints is only part of the story, according to a new hypothesis on the origin of urban life. The first villagers also had to cope with the cognitive demands and social stresses created by living in the midst of strangers. And the solutions that Neolithic humans invented, or at least stumbled on, are key features of cities today. For example, architecture that designates certain spaces for certain types of social interactions helps people know what to expect when entering a new building. Material trappings like jewelry and pottery signal the social group and status of strangers. And religion and elaborate group cultural rituals, like singing or dancing together, act as social glue among people in large groups.

	abstract = {Blau space consists of the multidimensional coordinate system, created by considering the set of socio-demographic variables as dimensions. All socio-demographic characteristics are potential elements of Blau space, including continuous characteristics such as age, years of education, income, occupational prestige, geographic location, and so forth. In addition, categorical measures of socio-demographic characteristics such as race, sex, religion, birthplace, and others are Blau dimensions. "Blau space" is a theoretical construct which was developed by Miller McPherson and named after Peter Blau. It was later elaborated by McPherson and Ranger-Moore.
The organizing force in Blau space is the homophily principle, which argues that the flow of information from person to person is a declining function of distance in Blau space. Persons located at great distance in Blau space are very unlikely to interact, which creates the conditions for social differences in any characteristic that is transmitted through social communication. The homophily principle thus localizes communication in Blau space, leading to the development of social niches for human activity and social organization.
Although the idea of Blau Space was originally developed to consider individuals, it was extended to the context of cities (and other urban units) in Neal's "Building a Blau{\"u}rban Space".},

These devices and the applications that run on them passively record social, mobility, and a variety of other behaviors of their users with extremely high spatial and temporal resolution. This thesis presents a variety of novel methods and analyses to leverage the data generated from these devices to understand human behavior within cities.

	abstract = {As cities worldwide grow, their residents must be able to traverse urban space in order to access employment, social services, recreation, and other critical activities. Urban accessibility reflects the ease of such access with respect to locations within a city, and it is largely dependent on the city's land use and transport systems. A variety of urban accessibility metrics have been proposed to guide urban policy and planning, but they have not been implemented systematically. Better understood and more widely adopted accessibility measures could help guide complex land use and multimodal transportation planning processes toward more eective and equitable outcomes. Such measures represent a signicant departure from the facility, maintenance, and mobility priorities that dominate transportation planning today, opening possibilities for new approaches. In particular, a clearer focus on accessibility could help prioritize and inform the design of bus rapid transit (BRT) projects, which tend to include dierent potential streetscape, transport, and network improvement options across a wide range of geographic and temporal scales. This thesis aims to develop a participatory framework built on an open-source, web-based toolkit that transit advocates and planners can use to visualize how urban design and operational characteristics of dierent incremental BRT scenarios might affect access at a personal level and accessibility at a regional level. Such visualizations can encompass the interaction of these scenarios with pedestrian, local bus, and rail connectivity, as well as regional land use. Built on Open Trip Planner Analyst and other web-based civic engagement platforms, as well as open data such as transit information in the general transit feed specification (GTFS) format, this toolkit is applied to transit performance and accessibility for example projects in two contexts, Boston and Santiago de Chile. Focus groups with transit advocates and planners were conducted in these two settings to evaluate the proposed toolkit. Members of community-based transit advocacy organizations found the toolkit to be both understandable and able to represent some of their key concerns; professional planners thought the toolkit could help them better understand existing operations and proposed projects. These evaluations suggest that the participatory framework developed around this toolkit could be an eective platform for dialogue between planners and community organizations. By connecting individual perspectives on access with broader accessibility metrics, this framework has the potential to build political will for the adoption of equitable accessibility indicators as decision-making metrics.},

	abstract = {Land use classification is important as a standard for land use description and management. However, current land use classification systems are problematic. Labels such as "residential use" and "commercial use" do not fully reveal how the land use is used in terms of function, mix use and changes over time. As a result, land use planning is often a natural prompt of segregation; Land use is poorly connected with other fields of urban studies such as transportation and energy consumption. The problems of land use are partly because land use classification has been an expediency rather than of rigorous thought. However, recent researches about land use classification have mainly focused on the methods of estimating land use types, without challenging the conventional instructional definition of land use typology itself. In contrast, this thesis aims to ask a more fundamental question: what are the elements, the principles, and the process to build the land use typology for given purposes. This thesis accordingly proposes the syntax of developing a land use typology, where five basic elements compose the framework of land use description: land use function, land use intensity, land use connectivity, probability and scale. While the elements are abstract concepts, when developing a land use typology, each of them could be defined with specific measures for purposes such as land use planning, land use management, energy analysis, transportation study. After the land use typology is composed with the defined elements, it can be applied to examine land mixed use, land use conflict, land use change and estimation. The syntax then proposes the basic principles and process to develop a satisfied land use typology, with respect to the reliability and validity, the significance and necessity, the measurability and operability, and the adaptability and flexibility. With that, this thesis argues that beyond the theoretical definition, the practical context, such as data availability or planning schema will influence the feasibility of a land use typology. While the scope of the syntax could be limited by practical tools and availability of data, the coming age of big data provides a changing context of land use typology. The followed case study illustrates such a process of developing land use typology with geo-social network data. The case develops a social media based land use typology, collects data for two example cities: Boston, U.S and Shenzhen, China, and applies the defined land use typology to classify their uses of land. As a result, Boston's land use I classified by its function, intensity and the level of mix use; Shenzhen land use is classified by its intensity, connectivity and the level of mix use. Compared with the conventional land use classification systems, the social media based typology provides a more comprehensive description of land use, with its focuses on human activities of the city and multiple dimensions of urban land use. It also has advantages with the flexibility and efficiency of data collection. In conclusion, the syntax of land use typology highlights the process of building land use typology, by defining the basic components of land use typology. It enables many possibilities of land use description with the help of big data, and reserves enough space to go beyond the existing tools and techniques.

	abstract = {"Big Data" is in vogue, and the explosion of urban sensors, mobile phone traces, and other windows onto urban activities has generated much hype about the advent of a new 'urban science.' However, translating such Big Data into a planning-relevant understanding of activity patterns and travel behavior presents a number of obstacles. This dissertation examines some of these obstacles and develops data processing pipelines and urban activity modeling techniques that can complement traditional travel surveys and facilitate the development of richer models of activity patterns and land use-transportation interactions. This study develops methods and tests their usefulness by using Singapore metropolitan area as an example, and employing data mining and statistical learning methods to distill useful spatiotemporal information on human activities by people and by place from traditional travel survey data, semantically enriched GIS data, massive and passive call detail records (CDR) data, and Wi-Fi augmented mobile positioning data. I illustrate that regularity and heterogeneity exist in individuals' daily activity patterns in the metropolitan area. I test the hypothesis that by characterizing and clustering individuals' activity profiles, and incorporating them into household decision choice models, we can characterize household lifestyles in ways that enhance our understanding and enable us to predict important decision-making processes within the urban system. I also demonstrate ways of integrating Big Data with traditional data sources in order to identify human mobility patterns, urban structures, and semantic themes of places reflected by human activities. Finally, I discuss how the enriched understanding about cities, human mobility, activity, and behavior choices derived from Big Data can make a difference in land use planning, urban growth management, and transportation policies.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hidden_Markov_model&oldid=716209275},
	abstract = {A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. An HMM can be presented as the simplest dynamic Bayesian network. The mathematics behind the HMM were developed by L. E. Baum and coworkers. It is closely related to an earlier work on the optimal nonlinear filtering problem by Ruslan L. Stratonovich, who was the first to describe the forward-backward procedure.
In simpler Markov models (like a Markov chain), the state is directly visible to the observer, and therefore the state transition probabilities are the only parameters. In a hidden Markov model, the state is not directly visible, but the output, dependent on the state, is visible. Each state has a probability distribution over the possible output tokens. Therefore, the sequence of tokens generated by an HMM gives some information about the sequence of states. The adjective 'hidden' refers to the state sequence through which the model passes, not to the parameters of the model; the model is still referred to as a 'hidden' Markov model even if these parameters are known exactly.
Hidden Markov models are especially known for their application in temporal pattern recognition such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics.
A hidden Markov model can be considered a generalization of a mixture model where the hidden variables (or latent variables), which control the mixture component to be selected for each observation, are related through a Markov process rather than independent of each other. Recently, hidden Markov models have been generalized to pairwise Markov models and triplet Markov models which allow consideration of more complex data structures  and the modelling of nonstationary data.},

	abstract = {Territorial subdivisions and geographic borders are essential for understanding phenomena in sociology, political science, history, and economics. They influence the interregional flow of information and cross-border trade and affect the diffusion of innovation and technology. However, it is unclear if existing administrative subdivisions that typically evolved decades ago still reflect the most plausible organizational structure of today. The complexity of modern human communication, the ease of long-distance movement, and increased interaction across political borders complicate the operational definition and assessment of geographic borders that optimally reflect the multi-scale nature of today's human connectivity patterns. What border structures emerge directly from the interplay of scales in human interactions is an open question. Based on a massive proxy dataset, we analyze a multi-scale human mobility network and compute effective geographic borders inherent to human mobility patterns in the United States. We propose two computational techniques for extracting these borders and for quantifying their strength. We find that effective borders only partially overlap with existing administrative borders, and show that some of the strongest mobility borders exist in unexpected regions. We show that the observed structures cannot be generated by gravity models for human traffic. Finally, we introduce the concept of link significance that clarifies the observed structure of effective borders. Our approach represents a novel type of quantitative, comparative analysis framework for spatially embedded multi-scale interaction networks in general and may yield important insight into a multitude of spatiotemporal phenomena generated by human activity.},

	abstract = {The focus of this paper is to learn the daily activity engagement patterns of travelers using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a modeling approach that is widely used in Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning. It is postulated that an individual{\textquoteright}s choice of activities depends not only on socio-demographic characteristics but also on previous activities of individual on the same day. In the paper, Markov Chain models are used to study the sequential choice of activities. The dependencies among activity type, activity sequence and socio-demographic data are captured by employing hidden Markov models. In order to learn model parameters, we use sequential multinomial logit models (MNL) and multiclass Support Vector Machines (K-SVM) with two different dependency structures. In the first dependency structure, it is assumed that type of activity at time {\textquoteleft}t{\textquoteright} depends on the last previous activity and socio-demographic data, whereas in the second structure we assume that activity selection at time {\textquoteleft}t{\textquoteright} depends on all of the individual{\textquoteright}s previous activity types on the same day and socio-demographic characteristics. The models are applied to data drawn from a set of California households and a comparison of the accuracy of estimation of activity types and their sequence in the agenda, indicates the superiority of K-SVM models over MNL. Additionally, we show that accuracy in estimating activity patterns increases using different sets of explanatory variables or tuning parameters of the kernel function in K-SVM.},

We study the problem of localizing users in a cellular network for calls with information regarding only one base station and hence triangulation or trilateration cannot be performed. In our call data records, this happens more than 50\% of time. We show how to localize mobiles based on our knowledge of the network layout and how to incorporate additional information such as round-trip-time and signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR) measurements. We study important parameters used in this Bayesian method through mining call data records and matching GPS records and obtain their distribution or typical values. We validate our localization technique in a commercial network with a few thousand emergency calls. The results show that the Bayesian method can reduce the localization error by 20\% compared to a blind approach and the accuracy of localization can be further improved by refining the a priori user distribution in the Bayesian technique.},

	abstract = {Individual human travel patterns captured by mobile phone data have been quantitatively characterized by mathematical models, but the underlying activities which initiate the movement are still in a less-explored stage. As a result of the nature of how activity and related travel decisions are made in daily life, human activity-travel behavior exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal regularities as well as sequential ordering. In this study, we investigate to what extent the behavioral routines could reveal the activities being performed at mobile phone call locations that are captured when users initiate or receive a voice call or message.

Our exploration consists of four steps. First, we define a set of comprehensive temporal variables characterizing each call location. Feature selection techniques are then applied to choose the most effective variables in the second step. Next, a set of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forests are employed to build classification models. Alongside, an ensemble of the results of the above models is also tested. Finally, the inference performance is further enhanced by a post-processing algorithm.

Using data collected from natural mobile phone communication patterns of 80 users over a period of more than one year, we evaluated our approach via a set of extensive experiments. Based on the ensemble of the models, we achieved prediction accuracy of 69.7\%. Furthermore, using the post processing algorithm, the performance obtained a 7.6\% improvement. The experiment results demonstrate the potential to annotate mobile phone locations based on the integration of data mining techniques with the characteristics of underlying activity-travel behavior, contributing towards the semantic comprehension and further application of the massive data.},

This information can be explored for a broad range of applications and services. However, it is impractical to ask a large number of people to record their daily activities. As the increasing popularity of GPS-enabled mobile devices, a huge amount of trajectories which show people's movement behaviors have been acquiring. The natural link between activities and traveling motivates us to investigate a novel approach to automatically extract sequences of activities from large set of trajectory data. Intuitively, activities can only happen when trajectory is geographically near for a proper period of time for these activities, such as 30 minutes for dining in a restaurant. In this work, the concepts influence and influence duration are proposed to capture the intuition. We also propose two algorithms to join large set of trajectories with activities with duplication reuse techniques. We conduct comprehensive empirical studies to evaluate the two algorithms with synthetic data set generated from real world POIs and road networks.},

	abstract = {The development of a city gradually fosters different functional regions, such as educational areas and business districts. In this paper, we propose a framework (titled DRoF) that Discovers Regions of different Functions in a city using both human mobility among regions and points of interests (POIs) located in a region. Specifically, we segment a city into disjointed regions according to major roads, such as highways and urban express ways. We infer the functions of each region using a topic-based inference model, which regards a region as a document, a function as a topic, categories of POIs (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) as metadata (like authors, affiliations, and key words), and human mobility patterns (when people reach/leave a region and where people come from and leave for) as words. As a result, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is featured by a distribution of mobility patterns. We further identify the intensity of each function in different locations. The results generated by our framework can benefit a variety of applications, including urban planning, location choosing for a business, and social recommendations. We evaluated our method using large-scale and real-world datasets, consisting of two POI datasets of Beijing (in 2010 and 2011) and two 3-month GPS trajectory datasets (representing human mobility) generated by over 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The results justify the advantages of our approach over baseline methods solely using POIs or human mobility.},

The basic idea of these indices is to build a relationship between the activity patterns (distribution, density, and diversity) and urban form. Accordingly, measurements, spatial analysis, and clustering methods are presented. Taking Singapore as a case study area, we applied the proposed indices and measurements to travel survey data of different years, through which centers of urban activities as well as the changing urban form are detected and compared quantitatively. Our approach yields important insights into urban phenomena generated by human movements. It represents a novel way of quantitative urban analysis and explicit urban change identification.},

Recently, mobile data-based research reached important conclusions about various aspects of human mobility patterns. But how accurately do these conclusions reflect the reality? To evaluate the difference between reality and approximation methods, we study in this paper the error between real human trajectory and the one obtained through mobile phone data using different interpolation methods (linear, cubic, nearest interpolations) taking into consideration mobility parameters. Moreover, we evaluate the error between real and estimated load using the proposed interpolation methods. From extensive evaluations based on real cellular network activity data of the state of Massachusetts, we show that, with respect to human trajectories, the linear interpolation offers the best estimation for sedentary people while the cubic one for commuters. Another important experimental finding is that trajectory estimation methods show different error regimes whether used within or outside the {\textquotedblleft}territory{\textquotedblright} of the user defined by the radius of gyration. Regarding the load estimation error, we show that by using linear and cubic interpolation methods, we can find the positions of the most crowded regions ({\textquotedblleft}hotspots{\textquotedblright}) with a median error lower than 7\%.},

Estimating the functions of urban space is of significant importance for detecting urban problems, evaluating planning strategies, and supporting policy making. In light of the potential of data mining and spatial analysis techniques for urban analysis, this paper proposes a method to infer urban functions at the building level using transportation data obtained from surveys and smart card systems. Specifically, we establish a two-step framework making use of the spatial relationships between trips, stops, and buildings. Firstly, information about the travel purposes for daily activities is deduced using passengers{\textquoteright} mobility patterns based on a probabilistic Bayesian model. Secondly, building functions are inferred by linking daily activities to the buildings surrounding the stops based on spatial statistics. We demonstrate the proposed method using large-scale public transportation data from two areas of Singapore. Our method is applied to identify building functions at building level. The result is verified with master plan, street view, and investigated data, and limitations are identified. Our work shows that the presented method is applicable in practice with a good accuracy. In a broader context, it shows the effectiveness of applying integrated techniques to combine multi-source data in order to make insights about social activities and complex urban space.},

These sequences serve as a key input for travel demand analysis and forecasting in the region. However, despite their importance, the lack of a reliable benchmark to evaluate the generated sequences has hampered further development and application of the models. With the wide deployment of mobile phone devices today, we explore the possibility of using the travel behavioral information derived from mobile phone data to build such a validation measure.

Our investigation consists of three steps. First, the daily trajectory of locations, where a user performed activities, is constructed from the mobile phone records. To account for the discrepancy between the stops revealed by the call data and the real location traces that the user has made, the daily trajectories are then transformed into actual travel sequences. Finally, all the derived sequences are classified into typical activity-travel patterns which, in combination with their relative frequencies, define an activity-travel profile. The established profile characterizes the current activity-travel behavior in the study area, and can thus be used as a benchmark for the assessment of the activity-based transportation models.

By comparing the activity-travel profiles derived from the call data with statistics that stem from traditional activity-travel surveys, the validation potential is demonstrated. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess how the results are affected by the different parameter settings defined in the profiling process.},

	abstract = {Passively generated mobile phone dataset is emerging as a new data source for research in human mobility patterns. Information on individuals{\textquoteright} trajectories is not directly available from such data; they must be inferred. Many questions remain in terms how well we can capture human mobility patterns from these datasets. Only one study has compared the results from a mobile phone dataset to those from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), though the comparison is on two different populations and samples. This study is a very first attempt that develops a procedure to generate a simulated mobile phone dataset containing the ground truth information. This procedure can be used by other researchers and practitioners who are interested in using mobile phone data and want to formally evaluate the effectiveness of an algorithm.

To identify activity locations from mobile phone traces, we develop an ensemble of methods: a model-based clustering method to identify clusters, a logistic regression model to distinguish between activity and travel clusters, and a set of behavior-based algorithms to detect types of locations visited. We show that the distribution of the activity locations identified from the simulated mobile phone dataset resembles the ground truth better than the existing studies. For home locations, 70\% and 97\% of identified homes are within 100 and 1000 m from the truth, respectively. For work places, 65\% and 86\% of the identified work places are within 100 and 1000 m from the true ones, respectively. These results point to the possibility of using these passively generated mobile phone datasets to supplement or even replace household travel surveys in transportation planning in the future.},

	abstract = {A relationship between people{\textquoteright}s mobility and their social networks is presented based on an analysis of calling and mobility traces for one year of anonymized call detail records of over one million mobile phone users in Portugal. We find that about 80\% of places visited are within just 20 km of their nearest (geographical) social ties{\textquoteright} locations. This figure rises to 90\% at a {\textquoteleft}geo-social radius{\textquoteright} of 45 km. In terms of their travel scope, people are geographically closer to their weak ties than strong ties. Specifically, they are 15\% more likely to be at some distance away from their weak ties than strong ties. The likelihood of being at some distance from social ties increases with the population density, and the rates of increase are higher for shorter geo-social radii. In addition, we find that area population density is indicative of geo-social radius where denser areas imply shorter radii. For example, in urban areas such as Lisbon and Porto, the geo-social radius is approximately 7 km and this increases to approximately 15 km for less densely populated areas such as Parades and Santa Maria da Feira.},

This research attempts to explore and interpret patterns embedded in the network of phone-call interaction and the network of phone-users{\textquoteright} movements, by considering the geographical context of mobile phone cells. We adopt an agglomerative clustering algorithm based on a Newman-Girvan modularity metric and propose an alternative modularity function incorporating a gravity model to discover the clustering structures of spatial-interaction communities using a mobile phone dataset from one week in a city in China. The results verify the distance decay effect and spatial continuity that control the process of partitioning phone-call interaction, which indicates that people tend to communicate within a spatial-proximity community. Furthermore, we discover that a high correlation exists between phone-users{\textquoteright} movements in physical space and phone-call interaction in cyberspace. Our approach presents a combined qualitative-quantitative framework to identify clusters and interaction patterns, and explains how geographical context influences communities of callers and receivers. The findings of this empirical study are valuable for urban structure studies as well as for the detection of communities in spatial networks.},

In this paper, we suggest that human interaction data, or human proximity, obtained by mobile phone Bluetooth sensor data, can be integrated with human location data, obtained by mobile cell tower connections, to mine meaningful details about human activities from large and noisy datasets. We propose a model, called bag of multimodal behavior, that integrates the modeling of variations of location over multiple time-scales, and the modeling of interaction types from proximity. Our representation is simple yet robust to characterize real-life human behavior sensed from mobile phones, which are devices capable of capturing large-scale data known to be noisy and incomplete. We use an unsupervised approach, based on probabilistic topic models, to discover latent human activities in terms of the joint interaction and location behaviors of 97 individuals over the course of approximately a 10-month period using data from MIT's Reality Mining project. Some of the human activities discovered with our multimodal data representation include {\textquotedblleft}going out from 7 pm-midnight alone{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}working from 11 am-5 pm with 3-5 other people,{\textquotedblright} further finding that this activity dominantly occurs on specific days of the week.

We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals.},

At the present, this kind of data is collected and stored by telecom operators infrastructures mainly for billing reasons, yet it represents a major source of information in the study of human mobility. In this paper, we propose an analytical process aimed at extracting interconnections between different areas of the city that emerge from highly correlated temporal variations of population local densities. To accomplish this objective, we propose a process based on two analytical tools: (i) a method to estimate the presence of people in different geographical areas; and (ii) a method to extract time- and space-constrained sequential patterns capable to capture correlations among geographical areas in terms of significant co-variations of the estimated presence. The methods are presented and combined in order to deal with two real scenarios of different spatial scale: the Paris Region and the whole France.},

We evaluate the merits of SOM as a cross-dimensional clustering technique and derived temporal trajectories of variations within the mobile communication profiles. The trajectories{\textquoteright} characteristics such as length are discussed, suggesting spatial variations in intensity and similarity in collective human activity. Trajectories are linked back to the geographic space to map the spatial and temporal variation of trajectory characteristics. Different trajectory lengths suggest that mobile phone activity is correlated with the spatial configuration of the city, and so at different times of the day.

	abstract = {Land-use classification is essential for urban planning. Urban land-use types can be differentiated either by their physical characteristics (such as reflectivity and texture) or social functions. Remote sensing techniques have been recognized as a vital method for urban land-use classification because of their ability to capture the physical characteristics of land use. Although significant progress has been achieved in remote sensing methods designed for urban land-use classification, most techniques focus on physical characteristics, whereas knowledge of social functions is not adequately used. Owing to the wide usage of mobile phones, the activities of residents, which can be retrieved from the mobile phone data, can be determined in order to indicate the social function of land use. This could bring about the opportunity to derive land-use information from mobile phone data. To verify the application of this new data source to urban land-use classification, we first construct a vector of aggregated mobile phone data to characterize land-use types. This vector is composed of two aspects: the normalized hourly call volume and the total call volume. A semi-supervised fuzzy c-means clustering approach is then applied to infer the land-use types. The method is validated using mobile phone data collected in Singapore. Land use is determined with a detection rate of 58.03\%. An analysis of the land-use classification results shows that the detection rate decreases as the heterogeneity of land use increases, and increases as the density of cell phone towers increases.},

Our observations are based on the analysis of communication data of 100,000 anonymized and randomly chosen individuals in a dataset of communications in Portugal. We show that clustering and principal component analysis allow for a significant dimension reduction with limited loss of information. The most important features are related to geographical location. In particular, we observe that most people spend most of their time at only a few locations. With the help of clustering methods, we then robustly identify home and office locations and compare the results with official census data.

	abstract = {Here we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.

	abstract = {Geospatial data matching is an important prerequisite for data integration, change detection and data updating. At present, crowdsourcing geospatial data are attracting considerable attention with its significant potential for timely and cost-effective updating of geospatial data and Geographical Information Science (GIS) applications. To integrate the available and up-to-date information of multi-source geospatial data, this article proposes a heuristic probabilistic relaxation road network matching method. The proposed method starts with an initial probabilistic matrix according to the dissimilarities in the shapes and then integrates the relative compatibility coefficient of neighbouring candidate pairs to iteratively update the initial probabilistic matrix until the probabilistic matrix is globally consistent. Finally, the initial 1:1 matching pairs are selected on the basis of probabilities that are calculated and refined on the basis of the structural similarity of the selected matching pairs. A process of matching is then implemented to find M:N matching pairs. Matching between OpenStreetMap network data and professional road network data shows that our method is independent of matching direction, successfully matches 1:0 (Null), 1:1 and M:N pairs, and achieves a robust matching precision of above 95\%.},

These transportation systems generate sizable transportation data, the mining of which can reveal the underlying urban phenomenon linked to city dynamics. This article presents a statistical model to automatically analyze the trip data of a bike sharing system. The proposed solution partitions (i.e., clusters) the stations according to their usage profiles. To do so, count series describing the stations{\textquoteright}s usage through departure/arrival counts per hour throughout the day are built and analyzed. The model for processing these count series is based on Poisson mixtures and introduces a station scaling factor that handles the differences between the stations{\textquoteright}s global usage. Differences between weekday and weekend usage are also taken into account. This model identifies the latent factors that shape the geography of trips, and the results may thus offer insights into the relationships between station neighborhood type (its amenities, its demographics, etc.) and the generated mobility patterns. In other words, the proposed method brings to light the different functions in different areas that induce specific patterns in BSS data. These potentials are demonstrated through an in-depth analysis of the results obtained on the Paris V{\'e}lib{\textquoteright} large-scale bike sharing system.},

	abstract = {Ushered by recent developments in various areas of science and technology, modern energy systems are going to be an inevitable part of our societies. Smart grids are one of these modern systems that have attracted many research activities in recent years. Before utilizing the next generation of smart grids, we should have a comprehensive understanding of the interdependent energy networks and processes. Next-generation energy systems networks cannot be effectively designed, analyzed, and controlled in isolation from the social, economic, sensing, and control contexts in which they operate. In this article, we present a novel framework to support charging and storage infrastructure design for electric vehicles. We develop coordinated clustering techniques to work with network models of urban environments to aid in placement of charging stations for an electrical vehicle deployment scenario. Furthermore, we evaluate the network before and after the deployment of charging stations, to recommend the installation of appropriate storage units to overcome the extra load imposed on the network by the charging stations. We demonstrate the multiple factors that can be simultaneously leveraged in our framework to achieve practical urban deployment. Our ultimate goal is to help realize sustainable energy system management in urban electrical infrastructure by modeling and analyzing networks of interactions between electric systems and urban populations.},

	abstract = {Urbanization's rapid progress has modernized many people's lives but also engendered big issues, such as traffic congestion, energy consumption, and pollution. Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community.},

Moreover, the mobile phone's enormous and enthusiastic adoption across most socioeconomic strata makes it a uniquely useful tool for conducting large-scale, representative behavioural research.

	abstract = {Nowadays, travel surveys provide rich information about urban mobility and commuting patterns. But, at the same time, they have drawbacks: they are static pictures of a dynamic phenomena, are expensive to make, and take prolonged periods of time to finish. However, the availability of mobile usage data (Call Detail Records) makes the study of urban mobility possible at levels not known before. This has been done in the past with good results--mobile data makes possible to find and understand aggregated mobility patterns. In this paper, we propose to analyze mobile data at individual level by estimating daily journeys, and use those journeys to build Origin-Destiny matrices to understand urban flow. We evaluate this approach with large anonymized CDRs from Santiago, Chile, and find that our method has a high correlation (\${\textbackslash}rho = 0.89\$) with the current travel survey, and that it captures external anomalies in daily travel patterns, making our method suitable for inclusion into urban computing applications.},

In this study, we analyse a large mobile phone dataset to explore the way life history influences human sociality and the way social networks are structured. Our results indicate that these aspects of human behaviour are strongly related to age and gender such that younger individuals have more contacts and, among them, males more than females. However, the rate of decrease in the number of contacts with age differs between males and females, such that there is a reversal in the number of contacts around the late 30s. We suggest that this pattern can be attributed to the difference in reproductive investments that are made by the two sexes. We analyse the inequality in social investment patterns and suggest that the age- and gender-related differences we find reflect the constraints imposed by reproduction in a context where time (a form of social capital) is limited.},

These are observed as administrative regional delimitations which are the outcome of complex geographical, political and historical processes which leave almost indelible footprints on infrastructure such as the street network. In this work, we uncover a set of hierarchies in Britain at different scales using percolation theory on the street network and on its intersections which are the primary points of interaction and urban agglomeration. At the larger scales, the observed hierarchical structures can be interpreted as regional fractures of Britain, observed in various forms, from natural boundaries, such as National Parks, to regional divisions based on social class and wealth such as the well-known North{\textendash}South divide. At smaller scales, cities are generated through recursive percolations on each of the emerging regional clusters. We examine the evolution of the morphology of the system as a whole, by measuring the fractal dimension of the clusters at each distance threshold in the percolation. We observe that this reaches a maximum plateau at a specific distance. The clusters defined at this distance threshold are in excellent correspondence with the boundaries of cities recovered from satellite images, and from previous methods using population density.},

The results show that ethnicity has a significant influence on the activity spaces of individuals. The biggest differences between the two population groups occur in Estonia outside the respondents{\textquoteright} home city of Tallinn, where the Russian-speaking minority was found to visit 45 percent fewer districts than Estonians. Moreover, they exhibit a preference for districts that are more heavily populated by a Russian-speaking population. With respect to international travel, the Russian-speaking minority visits fewer countries and are 3.6 times more likely to visit former Soviet Union countries than Estonians. The activity spaces of out-of-home nonemployment activities have fewer differences between the two groups in the respondents{\textquoteright} home city of Tallinn. Overall, our results show that ethnic differences have less effect on the everyday activity space and a greater influence on the choices made regarding long-distance travel.},

	abstract = {We modeled the mobility of mobile phone users in order to study the fundamental spreading patterns that characterize a mobile virus outbreak. We find that although Bluetooth viruses can reach all susceptible handsets with time, they spread slowly because of human mobility, offering ample opportunities to deploy antiviral software. In contrast, viruses using multimedia messaging services could infect all users in hours, but currently a phase transition on the underlying call graph limits them to only a small fraction of the susceptible users. These results explain the lack of a major mobile virus breakout so far and predict that once a mobile operating system{\textquoteright}s market share reaches the phase transition point, viruses will pose a serious threat to mobile communications.
Current mobile phone usage prevents major mobile virus outbreaks, but conditions could arise leading to a phone epidemic.

The investigation of the space{\textendash}time movements and daily distances of respondents showed that the majority of respondents had a similar temporal rhythm related to work, school, services and leisure in the city. Because of the different timing of those activities, the mobile positioning data made it possible to map functional differences in the city. The advantages and disadvantages of mobile positioning data in mapping urban life are discussed in the final section of the study.},

critical problem in trajectory clustering. Spatial generalization is an effective method to protect private
information and reduce data volume in trajectory data. This paper proposes the trajectory clustering
method based on spatial generalization.  We propose a new trajectory spatial generalization method
with multiple constraints. Firstly, we extract characteristic points on the basis of the trajectory features
such as time, position, speed, and so on, and then group the extracted characteristic points. Finally,
we connect regional centers of the groups in order to generate the generalized trajectories. Moreover,
we put forward a trajectory clustering method based on spatial generalization. In order to confirm our
clustering method, we make a similarity comparison on our generalization clustering results and others{\textquoteright}
results. Experiments on hurricane data show that our method can greatly reduce the data volume and
time consumption of trajectory clustering.},

This article reviews what data mining technology can do and asks and answers the question, Is data mining a violation of privacy that ought to be limited by law? - tort law in the case of an individual actor and Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in the case of a state actor.  Since data mining is a new technology and the existing data that are mined are presumed to be properly acquired, the answer would appear to be No.  However, we deduce from three hypothetical cases of what might be called pre-technological data mining that our intuitions tell us that data mining is indeed a violation of privacy.  We then review the case law - which does not agree with our intuitions - and briefly discuss alternative, technological means of protecting privacy in the face of advanced data mining techniques.There was no agreement, express or implied, not to use the PDF; the journal was given a license not a transfer of copyright.},

The existing distance functions are usually sensitive to noise, shifts and scaling of data that commonly occur due to sensor failures, errors in detection techniques, disturbance signals, and different sampling rates. Cleaning data to eliminate these is not always possible. In this paper, we introduce a novel distance function, Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) which is robust against these data imperfections. Analysis and comparison of EDR with other popular distance functions, such as Euclidean distance, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), Edit distance with Real Penalty (ERP), and Longest Common Subsequences (LCSS), indicate that EDR is more robust than Euclidean distance, DTW and ERP, and it is on average 50\% more accurate than LCSS. We also develop three pruning techniques to improve the retrieval efficiency of EDR and show that these techniques can be combined effectively in a search, increasing the pruning power significantly. The experimental results confirm the superior efficiency of the combined methods.},

ERP can be viewed as a perfect association between L1-norm and edit distance. It resembles L1-norm in being a metric distance function, and it resembles edit distance in being able to handle local time shifting. This new distance function is as natural for time series as existing distance functions, such as dynamic time wraping (DTW) and longest common subsequence (LCSS). Because ERP is a metric distance function, the triangle inequality can be used for pruning k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) queries. Further, the chapter introduces a new lower bound for ERP distance. Unlike existing lower bounds that require indexing with a multi-dimensional index, the proposed lower bound is one dimensional and can simply be implemented in a B+-tree that reduces the storage requirement and save the possible I/O cost in consequence. Because pruning by the triangle inequality and by lower bounds are orthogonal, the two strategies are combined. This combination can be considered as an extension of GEMINI framework for indexing time series data with a metric.},

In this paper, we develop a novel methodology to reveal cabdrivers{\textquoteright} operation patterns by analyzing their continuous digital traces. For the first time, we systematically study large scale cabdrivers{\textquoteright} behavior in a real and complex city context through their daily digital traces. We identify a set of valuable features, which are simple and effective to classify cabdrivers, delineate cabdrivers{\textquoteright} operation patterns and compare the different cabdrivers{\textquoteright} behavior. The methodology and steps could spatially and temporally quantify, visualize, and examine different cabdrivers{\textquoteright} operation patterns. Drivers were categorized into top drivers and ordinary drivers by their daily income. We use the daily operations of 3000 cabdrivers in over 48 million of trips and 240 million kilometers to uncover: (1) spatial selection behavior, (2) context-aware spatio-temporal operation behavior, (3) route choice behavior, and (4) operation tactics. Though we focused on cabdriver operation patterns analysis from their digital traces, the methodology is a general empirical and analytical methodology for any GPS-like trace analysis. Our work demonstrates the great potential to utilize the massive pervasive data sets to understand human behavior and high-level intelligence.},

However, all these studies analyze taxicab trips and mobile phone movements separately. In this paper, we: (1) integrate mobile phone and taxicab usages together to explore human movements in Singapore and reveal that mobile phone movements as a general proxy to all kinds of human mobility has substantially different characteristics compared to taxicab trips, which are one of the frequently used means of transportation; (2) investigate the ratio of taxicab trips and mobile phone movements between two arbitrary locations, which not only characterizes taxicab demands between these locations but also sheds light on underlying land use patterns. In details, we quantify the distinct characteristics of mobile phone movements and taxicab trips, and particularly confirm that the number of taxicab trips decays with distance more slowly compared to mobile phone movements. From a spatial network perspective, taxicab trips largely reflect interactions between further-separating locations than mobile phone movements, resulting in emergence of larger spatial communities (delineated based on people mobility) in Singapore. The contribution of this research is two-fold: (1) we clarified the divergences between observed human mobility patterns based on taxicab and mobile phone data; (2) we implemented an integrated approach of taxicab and mobile phone usages for gaining more informative insights in population dynamics, transportation and urban configuration.},

This paper explores how conceptual modeling could provide applications with direct support of trajectories (i.e. movement data that is structured into countable semantic units) as a first class concept. A specific concern is to allow enriching trajectories with semantic annotations allowing users to attach semantic data to specific parts of the trajectory. Building on a preliminary requirement analysis and an application example, the paper proposes two modeling approaches, one based on a design pattern, the other based on dedicated data types, and illustrates their differences in terms of implementation in an extended-relational context.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in sensory and mobile computing technology, enormous amounts of data about moving objects are being collected. One important application with such data is automated identification of suspicious movements. Due to the sheer volume of data associated with moving objects, it is challenging to develop a method that can efficiently and effectively detect anomalies. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that anomalies may occur at arbitrary levels of abstraction and be associated with multiple granularity of spatiotemporal features. In this study, we propose a new framework named ROAM (Rule- and Motif-based Anomaly Detection in Moving Objects). In ROAM, object trajectories are expressed using discrete pattern fragments called motifs. Associated features are extracted to form a hierarchical feature space, which facilitates a multi-resolution view of the data. We also develop a general-purpose, rule-based classifier which explores the structured feature space and learns effective rules at multiple levels of granularity. We implemented ROAM and tested its components under a variety of conditions. Our experiments show that the system is efficient and effective at detecting abnormal moving objects.},

In this paper we set out to address the problem of extracting urban patterns from fragments of multiple and sparse people life traces, as they emerge from the participation to social network. To investigate this challenging task, we analyzed 13 millions Twitter posts (3 GB) of data in New York. Then we test upon this data a probabilistic topic models approach to automatically extract urban patterns from location-based social network data. We find that the extracted patterns can identify hotspots in the city, and recognize a number of major crowd behaviors that recur over time and space in the urban scenario.},

In this paper, we investigate human mobility patterns through analyzing taxi-trace datasets collected from five metropolitan cities in two countries. We focus on three statistics for each dataset: the displacement of each occupied trip, the duration of each occupied trip, and the time interval between successive occupied trips by the same taxi (interevent time). The results indicate that the displacement distributions of human travel by taxi tend to follow exponential laws in two displacement ranges rather than power laws; the trip duration distributions can be approximated by log-normal distributions; the interevent time distributions can be well characterized by log-normal bodies followed by power law tails. For each considered measure, the rescaled distributions of all cities collapsed into a master curve. These results provide empirical evidence supporting the common regularity of intra-city human mobility. Moreover, we show that airport locations could play a role in explaining the spikes of displacement distributions of taxi trips in certain cities.},

	abstract = {Advancements of information, communication and location-aware technologies have made collections of various passively generated datasets possible. These datasets provide new opportunities to understand human mobility patterns at a low cost and large scale. This study presents a home-based approach to understanding human mobility patterns based on a large mobile phone location dataset from Shenzhen, China. First, we estimate each individual{\textquoteright}s {\textquotedblleft}home{\textquotedblright} anchor point, and a modified standard distance (S'DSD'S\_\{D\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \}) is proposed to measure the spread of each individual{\textquoteright}s activity space centered at this {\textquotedblleft}home{\textquotedblright} anchor point. We then derive aggregate mobility patterns at mobile phone tower level to describe the distance distribution of S'DSD'S\_\{D\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} for people who share the same {\textquotedblleft}home{\textquotedblright} anchor point. A hierarchical clustering algorithm is performed and the spatial distributions of the derived clusters are analyzed to highlight areas with similar aggregate human mobility patterns. The results suggest that 43 \% of the population sample travelled within a short distance (S'D<=1kmSD'<=1kmS\_\{D\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} {\textbackslash}le 1 {\textbackslash};\{{\textbackslash}text\{km\}\}) during the 13-day study period while 23.9 \% of them were associated with a large activity space (S'D>=5kmSD'>=5kmS\_\{D\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime \} {\textbackslash}ge 5 {\textbackslash};\{{\textbackslash}text\{km\}\}). The geographical differences of people{\textquoteright}s mobility patterns in Shenzhen are evident. Areas with a large proportion of people who have a small activity space mainly locate in the northern part of Shenzhen such as Baoan and Longgang districts. In the southern part where the economy is highly developed, the percentage of people with a larger activity space is higher in general. The findings could offer useful implications on policy and decision making. The proposed approach can also be used in other studies involving similar spatiotemporal datasets for travel behavior and policy analysis.},

	abstract = {Author Summary The spatial dissemination of a directly transmitted infectious disease in a population is driven by population movements from one region to another allowing mixing and importation. Public health policy and planning may thus be more accurate if reliable descriptions of population movements can be considered in the epidemic evaluations. Next to census data, generally available in developed countries, alternative solutions can be found to describe population movements where official data is missing. These include mobility models, such as the radiation model, and the analysis of mobile phone activity records providing individual geo-temporal information. Here we explore to what extent mobility proxies, such as mobile phone data or mobility models, can effectively be used in epidemic models for influenza-like-illnesses and how they compare to official census data. By focusing on three European countries, we find that phone data matches the commuting patterns reported by census well but tends to overestimate the number of commuters, leading to a faster diffusion of simulated epidemics. The order of infection of newly infected locations is however well preserved, whereas the pattern of epidemic invasion is captured with higher accuracy by the radiation model for centrally seeded epidemics and by phone proxy for peripherally seeded epidemics.},

	abstract = {The recent adoption of ubiquitous computing technologies has enabled capturing large amounts of human behavioral data. The digital footprints computed from these datasets provide information for the study of social and human dynamics, including social networks and mobility patterns, key elements for the effective modeling of virus spreading. Traditional epidemiologic models do not consider individual information and hence have limited ability to capture the inherent complexity of the disease spreading process. To overcome this limitation, agent-based models have recently been proposed as an effective approach to model virus spreading. However, most agent-based approaches to date have not included real-life data to characterize the agents' behavior. In this paper we propose an agent-based system that uses social interactions and individual mobility patterns extracted from call detail records to accurately model virus spreading. The proposed approach is applied to study the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Mexico and to evaluate the impact that government mandates had on the spreading of the virus. Our simulations indicate that the restricted mobility due the government mandates reduced by 10\% the peak number of individuals infected by the virus and postponed the peak of the pandemic by two days.},

Facing these possible and unexpected disasters, accurately predicting human emergency behavior and their mobility will become the critical issue for planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. In this paper, we build up a large human mobility database (GPS records of 1.6 million users over one year) and several different datasets to capture and analyze human emergency behavior and their mobility following the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima nuclear accident. Based on our empirical analysis through these data, we find that human behavior and their mobility following large-scale disaster sometimes correlate with their mobility patterns during normal times, and are also highly impacted by their social relationship, intensity of disaster, damage level, government appointed shelters, news reporting, large population flow and etc. On the basis of these findings, we develop a model of human behavior that takes into account these factors for accurately predicting human emergency behavior and their mobility following large-scale disaster. The experimental results and validations demonstrate the efficiency of our behavior model, and suggest that human behavior and their movements during disasters may be significantly more predictable than previously thought.},

In this paper, we evaluate the bias induced by the use of CDRs for inferring important locations of mobile subscribers, as well as their complete trajectories.  Besides, we propose a novel technique for estimating real human trajectories from sparse CDRs.  Compared to previous solutions in the literature, our proposed technique reduces the error between real and estimated human trajectories and at the same time shortens the temporal period where users{\textquoteright} locations remain undefined.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength $\Omega$ becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system $\omega$. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large $\Omega$/$\omega$c = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling $\Omega$ ? ?n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 {\texttimes} 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ({\textless};100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled ($\Omega$/$\omega$- {\textbar}{\textbar}},

	abstract = {Cell phone call location data has been utilized for the study of travel patterns, but the underlying activities that originate the movement are still at a less explored stage. Resulted from routine and automated features of decision-making processes, human activity and travel behaviour exhibit a high level of spatial-temporal periodicities as well as a certain order of the activities. In this chapter, a method has been developed based on these regularities, which predicts activities being conducted at call locations. The method includes four steps: a set of comprehensive variables is defined; feature selection techniques are applied; a group of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and an ensemble of the above algorithms are employed; an additional enhancement algorithm is designed. Using data gathered from natural communication of 80 users over a period of 1 year, the proposed method is evaluated. Based on the ensemble of the models, prediction accuracy of 69.7\% was achieved. Using the enhancement algorithm, the performance obtained 7.6\% improvement. The experimental results demonstrate the potential to annotate call locations based on the integration between machine learning algorithms and the characteristics of underlying activity and travel behaviour, contributing towards the semantic interpretation and application of the massive data.},

{\textless}/span{\textgreater}For both the Zipf distribution and the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution, the exponent \textit{a} must be greater than 1 for the distribution to be well-defined, it must be greater than 2 for the mean to be finite, and it must be greater than 3 for the variance to be finite.{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div{\textgreater}So far, I have been unable to find an {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} package that supports the generation of random samples drawn from the Zipf distribution, but the package {\textless}strong{\textgreater}zipfR{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} includes the command {\textless}strong{\textgreater}rlnre{\textless}/strong{\textgreater}, which generates random samples drawn from the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution.{\textless}span{\textgreater}\&nbsp; {\textless}/span{\textgreater}As I noted, this distribution can be parameterized in several different ways and, as Murphy\&rsquo;s law would have it, the {\textless}strong{\textgreater}zipfR{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} parameterization is not the same as the one presented above and discussed in {\textless}em{\textgreater}Exploring Data{\textless}/em{\textgreater}.{\textless}span{\textgreater}\&nbsp;

{\textless}/span{\textgreater}(As with all {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} random number generators, the {\textless}strong{\textgreater}set.seed{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} command should be used first to initialize the random number generator seed if you want to get repeatable results;

{\textless}/span{\textgreater}To get what you want (e.g., the labels \&ldquo;1339\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;73\&rdquo; assigned to the numbers 1339 and 73, respectively), you need to first convert the factors in {\textless}strong{\textgreater}zmsample{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} into characters and then convert these characters into numeric values:{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/div{\textgreater}{\textless}div{\textgreater}{\textless}span{\textgreater}\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;\&nbsp;

{\textless}/span{\textgreater}Since the range of these indices can be quite large in the slowly-decaying members of the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution family, the plots are drawn with logarithmic x-axes, and to facilitate comparisons, the x-axes have the same range in all three plots, as do the y-axes.{\textless}span{\textgreater}\&nbsp;

	abstract = {Large collections of trajectories provide rich insight into movement patterns of the tracked objects. By map matching trajectories to a road network as sequences of road edge IDs, contiguous sequential patterns can be extracted as a certain number of objects traversing a specific path, which provides valuable information in travel demand modeling and transportation planning. Mining and visualization of such patterns still face challenges in efficiency, scalability, and visual cluttering of patterns. To address these challenges, this article firstly proposes a Bidirectional Pruning based Closed Contiguous Sequential pattern Mining (BP-CCSM) algorithm. By employing tree structures to create partitions of input sequences and candidate patterns, closeness can be checked efficiently by comparing nodes in a tree. Secondly, a system called Sequential Pattern Explorer for Trajectories (SPET) is built for spatial and temporal exploration of the mined patterns. Two types of maps are designed where a conventional traffic map gives an overview of the movement patterns and a dynamic offset map presents detailed information according to user-specified filters. Extensive experiments are performed in this article. BP-CCSM is compared with three other state-of-the-art algorithms on two datasets: a small public dataset containing clickstreams from an e-commerce and a large global positioning system dataset with more than 600,000 taxi trip trajectories. The results show that BP-CCSM considerably outperforms three other algorithms in terms of running time and memory consumption. Besides, SPET provides an efficient and convenient way to inspect spatial and temporal variations in closed contiguous sequential patterns from a large number of trajectories.},

However, very little work has focused on analyzing the social response to an urban earthquake as it takes place. In this paper we present a preliminary study of the social response using the information collected from a cell-phone network during the 2012 Oaxaca earthquake in Mexico. We focus our analysis on four urban environments located between 100-200km away from the epicenter of the earthquake. The social response is analyzed using four different variables: call volume, call duration, social activity and mobility. Initial results indicate a social response characterized by an increase in the number of calls, a decrease in call durations, a moderate increase in the number of people contacted by highly connected citizens and a moderate increase in the mobility.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_swan_theory&oldid=804904370},
	abstract = {The black swan theory or theory of black swan events is a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. The term is based on an ancient saying which presumed black swans did not exist, but the saying was rewritten after black swans were discovered in the wild.
The theory was developed by Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain:
The disproportionate role of high-profile, hard-to-predict, and rare events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations in history, science, finance, and technology.
The non-computability of the probability of the consequential rare events using scientific methods (owing to the very nature of small probabilities).
The psychological biases that blind people, both individually and collectively, to uncertainty and to a rare event's massive role in historical affairs.
Unlike the earlier and broader "black swan problem" in philosophy (i.e. the problem of induction), Taleb's "black swan theory" refers only to unexpected events of large magnitude and consequence and their dominant role in history. Such events, considered extreme outliers, collectively play vastly larger roles than regular occurrences. More technically, in the scientific monograph 'Silent Risk', Taleb mathematically defines the black swan problem as "stemming from the use of degenerate metaprobability".},

	abstract = {The Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima nuclear accident cause large human population movements and evacuations. Understanding and predicting these movements is critical for planning effective humanitarian relief, disaster management, and long-term societal reconstruction. In this paper, we construct a large human mobility database that stores and manages GPS records from mobile devices used by approximately 1.6 million people throughout Japan from 1 August 2010 to 31 July 2011. By mining this enormous set of Auto-GPS mobile sensor data, the short-term and long-term evacuation behaviors for individuals throughout Japan during this disaster are able to be automatically discovered. To better understand and simulate human mobility during the disasters, we develop a probabilistic model that is able to be effectively trained by the discovered evacuations via machine learning technique. Based on our training model, population mobility in various cities impacted by the disasters throughout the country is able to be automatically simulated or predicted. On the basis of the whole database, developed model, and experimental results, it is easy for us to find some new features or population mobility patterns after the recent severe earthquake, tsunami and release of radioactivity in Japan, which are likely to play a vital role in future disaster relief and management worldwide.},

However, making population-level inferences using these data is complicated by differential ownership of phones among different demographic groups that may exhibit variable mobility. Here, we quantify the effects of ownership bias on mobility estimates by coupling two data sources from the same country during the same time frame. We analyse mobility patterns from one of the largest mobile phone datasets studied, representing the daily movements of nearly 15 million individuals in Kenya over the course of a year. We couple this analysis with the results from a survey of socioeconomic status, mobile phone ownership and usage patterns across the country, providing regional estimates of population distributions of income, reported airtime expenditure and actual airtime expenditure across the country. We match the two data sources and show that mobility estimates are surprisingly robust to the substantial biases in phone ownership across different geographical and socioeconomic groups.},

We then use a Bayesian classification model to identify affected individuals by observing changes in calling behaviour following the plant's closure. For these affected individuals, we observe significant declines in social behaviour and mobility following job loss. Using the features identified at the micro level, we show that the same changes in these calling behaviours, aggregated at the regional level, can improve forecasts of macro unemployment rates.

These factors are particularly relevant in the case of mass gatherings, which may act as hotspots of disease transmission and spread. Understanding these dynamics, however, is usually limited by the lack of accurate data, especially in developing countries. Mobile phone call data provide a new, first-order source of information that allows the tracking of the evolution of mobility fluxes with high resolution in space and time. Here, we analyze a dataset of mobile phone records of \~{}150,000 users in Senegal to extract human mobility fluxes and directly incorporate them into a spatially explicit, dynamic epidemiological framework. Our model, which also takes into account other drivers of disease transmission such as rainfall, is applied to the 2005 cholera outbreak in Senegal, which totaled more than 30,000 reported cases. Our findings highlight the major influence that a mass gathering, which took place during the initial phase of the outbreak, had on the course of the epidemic. Such an effect could not be explained by classic, static approaches describing human mobility. Model results also show how concentrated efforts toward disease control in a transmission hotspot could have an important effect on the large-scale progression of an outbreak.},

	abstract = {Smartphones with embedded Global Positioning Systems (GPS) sensors and accelerometers provide outstanding opportunities to gather information about transportation modes. In comparison to traditional approaches of measuring travel behavior, such as self-reports and travel behavior surveys, a smartphone application that tracks movement increases spatiotemporal resolution and reduces the burden on individuals to manually recall and log travel behavior. Studies using smartphones to detect travel modes mainly use segmentation approaches, which divide movement data into single-mode segments. These approaches hinge on the accurate detection of transitional nodes, which are occasionally difficult to identify. In this study, we proposed a method to detect travel modes based on the chained random forest (RF) model, which automatically classifies smartphone data into different travel modes without using a prior search for transitional nodes. We evaluated the proposed method by collecting and analyzing 12 people's travel behavior spanning six days. The proposed method achieved 93.8\% overall accuracy and performed well in both indoor and outdoor environments. This travel mode detection model offers potentials in conducting pervasive sensing, which will eventually benefit many areas of research that require large scale travel behavior monitoring.},

Understanding and predicting the locations of affected people during disasters is key to effective humanitarian relief operations and to long-term societal reconstruction. We collaborated with the largest mobile phone operator in Haiti (Digicel) and analyzed the movements of 1.9 million mobile phone users during the period from 42 d before, to 341 d after the devastating Haiti earthquake of January 12, 2010. Nineteen days after the earthquake, population movements had caused the population of the capital Port-au-Prince to decrease by an estimated 23\%. Both the travel distances and size of people{\textquoteright}s movement trajectories grew after the earthquake. These findings, in combination with the disorder that was present after the disaster, suggest that people{\textquoteright}s movements would have become less predictable. Instead, the predictability of people{\textquoteright}s trajectories remained high and even increased slightly during the three-month period after the earthquake. Moreover, the destinations of people who left the capital during the first three weeks after the earthquake was highly correlated with their mobility patterns during normal times, and specifically with the locations in which people had significant social bonds. For the people who left Port-au-Prince, the duration of their stay outside the city, as well as the time for their return, all followed a skewed, fat-tailed distribution. The findings suggest that population movements during disasters may be significantly more predictable than previously thought.},

We show that the number of places visited by each person (Points of Interest {\textendash} PoIs) is regulated by some properties that are statistically similar among individuals. Subsequently, we present a PoIs classification in terms of their relevance on a per-user basis. In addition to the PoIs relevance, we also investigate the variables that describe the travel rules among PoIs in particular, the spatial and temporal distance. As regards the latter, existing works on mobility are mainly based on spatial distance. Here we argue, rather, that for human mobility the temporal distance and the PoIs relevance are the major driving factors. Moreover, we study the semantic of PoIs. This is useful for deriving statistics on people{\textquoteright}s habits without breaking their privacy. With the support of different datasets, our paper provides an in-depth analysis of PoIs distribution and semantics; it also shows that our results hold independently of the nature of the dataset in use.

In this paper, we consider it from the perspective of a multi-layer complex network, built using a combination of three datasets: Twitter, Flickr and official migration data. Those datasets provide different, but equally important insights on the global mobility {\textendash} while the first two highlight short-term visits of people from one country to another, the last one {\textendash} migration {\textendash} shows the long-term mobility perspective, when people relocate for good. The main purpose of the paper is to emphasize importance of this multi-layer approach capturing both aspects of human mobility at the same time. On the one hand, we show that although the general properties of different layers of the global mobility network are similar, there are important quantitative differences among them. On the other hand, we demonstrate that consideration of mobility from a multi-layer perspective can reveal important global spatial patterns in a way more consistent with those observed in other available relevant sources of international connections, in comparison to the spatial structure inferred from each network layer taken separately.},

Objectives: Develop models of long-distance human travel based on questionnaire data describing the longest distance traveled by someone in a household over one week, one month, 6 months, and 1 year.
Methods and Analysis: Mathematical models were generated based on the daily travel and N-day routine hypotheses. The parameters were estimated through maximum likelihood method, and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) was used to assess the goodness of fit.
Results and Conclusions: Household location was an important factor shaping human mobility. A routine-travel cycle consisting of 11-13 days provided the best fit (BIC = 29802). Daily human movement and human movement overall may be best explained by routines that are repeated biweekly or perhaps longer.},

In our previous work we have shown that the number of visited points of interest (PoIs) of each person is regulated by some laws that are statistically similar among individuals, and we gave some classification of them in terms of their relevance. We investigate here the variables that characterize the way humans move among PoIs, and in particular the spatial and temporal distances between PoIs and the PoIs relevance. With this respect, most of the existing work on mobility, especially on its modeling, is based only on spatial distance, while we argue here that for human mobility the temporal distance and the PoIs relevance are essential factors. Also, by comparing the geographical and temporal distances between consecutive PoIs, we observe a smoother and more linear trend in the temporal case. The results suggest that the time, rather than physical distance, could represent a better measure of distance among PoIs, mainly due to the transportation facilities. We present here our analysis of this aspect, considering two different datasets, to show the validity of our results independently of the nature of the dataset under consideration, and to extract considerations on different scenario scales. We argue that these results can be seminal to novel mobility research.},

However, this topic is essential for a deeper study from human dynamics and social networks aspects. In this paper, we examine the location history data and social networks data of 712 email users and 399 offline events users from a map-editing based social network website. Based on these data, we expand all our experiment both from individual aspect and community aspect. We find that the physical distance is still the most influential factor to social ties among the nine representative human mobility features extracted from our GPS trajectory dataset, although Internet revolution has made long-distance communication dramatically faster, easier and cheaper than ever before, and in turn, partly expand the physical scope of social networks. Furthermore, we find that to a certain extent, the proximity of South-North direction is more influential than East-West direction to social ties. To the our best of our knowledge, this difference between South-North and East-West is the first time to be raised and quantitatively supported by a large dataset. We believe our findings on the interplay of human mobility and social ties offer a new perspective to this field of study. {\textcopyright} 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

We determined the distinct mobility patterns of natives and non-natives in all five large cities that we considered. We used a mixed method to assign different algorithms to natives and non-natives, which greatly improved the accuracy of location prediction compared with the basic algorithms. We also propose so-called indigenization coefficients to quantify the extent to which an individual behaves like a native, which depends only on their check-in behavior, rather than requiring demographic information. Surprisingly, the hybrid algorithm weighted using the indigenization coefficients outperformed a mixed algorithm that used additional demographic information, suggesting the advantage of behavioral data in characterizing individual mobility compared with the demographic information. The present location prediction algorithms can find applications in urban planning, traffic forecasting, mobile recommendation, and so on.},

Even if the complexity of individual behaviors prevents a true microscopic approach, the introduction of mesoscopic models allows the study of the dynamical properties for the non-stationary states of the considered system. We propose to compute various entropy measures of the individual mobility patterns obtained from GPS data that record the movements of private vehicles in the Florence district, in order to point out new features of human mobility related to the use of time and space and to define the dynamical properties of a stochastic model that could generate similar patterns. Moreover, we can relate the predictability properties of human mobility to the distribution of time passed between two successive trips. Our analysis suggests the existence of a hierarchical structure in the mobility patterns which divides the performed activities into three different categories, according to the time cost, with different information contents. We show that a Markov process defined by using the individual mobility network is not able to reproduce this hierarchy, which seems the consequence of different strategies in the activity choice. Our results could contribute to the development of governance policies for a sustainable mobility in modern cities.},

In physical activity research, using GPS trajectories and advanced GIS methods has a potential for greatly enhancing our understanding of the association between objectively measured moderate and vigorous physical activity and physical and social environments. Relying only on objectively measured physical activity intensity, however, ignores the role of different places and types of physical activity on people's health outcomes. The aim of this study is to propose an approach to classifying physical activity in free-living conditions for physical activity research using published smartphone accelerometer data. Random forest and gradient boosting are used to predict jogging, walking, sitting, and standing. Generated training models based on the two classifiers are tested on accelerometer data collected from the smartphones of two subjects in free-living conditions. GPS trajectories with predicted physical activity labels are visually explored on a map to offer new insight on the assessment of the predicted results of daily activities and the identification of any difference in the results between random forest and gradient boosting. The findings of this study indicate that random forest and gradient boosting enable accurate physical activity classification in free-living conditions. GPS trajectories linked with predicted labels on a map assist the visual exploration of the erroneous prediction in daily activities including in-vehicle activities.},

	abstract = {The widespread use of social media provides extraordinary amounts of user-generated data every day. The recent introduction of the location-based services in smartphone-based social media applications allows people to share their activity related choices at the level of specific geo-referenced location and time. This geo-location data offers us, in new ways, people's attitudes, interests and activity patterns over a wide network and over multiple months/years that was unimaginable before. However, while this new data is available, there are currently limited methodologies that allow us to analyze these large data sets to obtain useful information by characterization and analysis of individual level activity patterns and network level dynamics that are important for understanding urban dynamics. This dissertation presents a new paradigm to activity-travel behavior analysis by analyzing this large-scale geo-location data, recording human movements over many days, to understand long-term individual mobility patterns, infer short-term individual activity and lifestyle patterns and estimate network traffic congestion.
The overarching goal of this dissertation is to develop data analytics to understand urban mobility dynamics and user behavior using geo-located social media data. It develops novel statistical estimation techniques, motivated from machine learning approaches, for understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of urban activities. First, long-term patterns of human mobility are described by the statistical properties obtained through data analysis. To explain these properties, a physics-based model which contradicts sharply with the existing mobility models is developed. Second, in this thesis, data-driven techniques for modeling user activity patterns and life-style choices are developed. Third, a novel method is developed to infer individual activity type, its duration and location, and the sequence of the activities from incomplete trajectory data. When aggregated these activity-location sequences are indicators of travel demand within a region. The potential of geo-location data to derive dynamic traffic patterns in transportation networks is investigated. Fourth, this thesis explores the social dimension of activity participation behavior and measures the role of social influence in user activity location choices.
This thesis provides a holistic understanding of urban mobility and activity patterns by analyzing large-scale geo-location data which has limitations including absence of socio-demographic characteristics of the users, missing activities and unknown activity duration. It develops novel methods motivated by machine learning approaches addressing these limitations of geo-location data for inferring individual-level patterns. These methodologies may become more useful and relevant for transportation analysis in near future with the availability of mobility data collected from cell phone call recordings, smart phone GPS recordings or check-ins from location-based applications in social media. Given the lack of appropriate methodologies to characterize this information, this thesis expects to make a novel and transformative contribution to activity behavior and transportation system analysis.},

In this paper, we propose a methodology to measure travel behavior regularity based on the order in which trips or activities are organized. We represent individuals' travel over multiple days as sequences of 'travel events'{\textendash}discrete and repeatable behavior units explicitly defined based on the research question and the available data. We then present a metric of regularity based on entropy rate, which is sensitive to both the frequency of travel events and the order in which they occur. The methodology is demonstrated using a large sample of pseudonymised transit smart card transaction records from London, U.K. The entropy rate is estimated with a procedure based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform. The results confirm that the order of travel events is an essential component of regularity in travel behavior. They also demonstrate that the proposed measure of regularity captures both conventional patterns and atypical routine patterns that are regular but not matched to the 9-to-5 working day or working week. Unlike existing measures of regularity, our approach is agnostic to calendar definitions and makes no assumptions regarding periodicity of travel behavior. The proposed methodology is flexible and can be adapted to study other aspects of individual mobility using different data sources.},

Compared to many existing classification methods (e.g., hot-spot detection, sequential alignment method), the network method substantiates the social meanings underlying the interconnectedness and similarities of people's activity trajectories and better integrates spatial interaction (colocation or distance-decay) and temporal connections (concurrence or sequence) of daily lives in the measure of similarity. This approach enables us to detect variant community structures, with individuals in the same community interacting relatively more than individuals belonging to different communities, by decomposing the complex trajectories into different meaningful events (e.g., activities, trips, tours, and subsequences). We also demonstrate the practicality and scientific merit of the network analysis approach in a case study of household travel behavior in Charlotte, North Carolina. Results derived from disaggregated survey data establish the effectiveness and flexibility of the network methods to detect cohesive communities of individuals and ATPs by different narratives of everyday-life events. This study also suggests that the network analysis approach has great potential to classify large datasets of other space-time trajectories and to discover policy-sensitive activity, trip, and tour patterns that help us develop policy and planning alternatives for sustainable communities and mobility.},

	abstract = {Interests in studying of the built environment impacts on travel behavior have proliferated from North America to other parts of the world including China. Until very recently, there has been very little research into travel behavior in China. However, during the last decade, there has been a fast growing interest in studying the built environment and travel behavior in Chinese cities, perhaps motivated by China{\textquoteright}s unprecedented urbanization and rapid urban transport development. Case studies from China provide new insights into the impacts of built environment on travel behavior that can help to enrich existing scholarship. However, currently there is a generally poor understanding of the role played by Chinese research and how it has enriched the international literature. This paper aims to fill this gap by reviewing studies in and outside China by both Chinese and non-Chinese scholars. The focus is on the contribution of these studies to the international literature. We identify four areas of contribution: how the built environment has been developed and its implications for travel behavior; the importance of housing sources in defining residential built environment and explaining travel behavior; the unique Danwei (or work unit) perspective on jobs-housing relationships and commuting behavior; and the importance of neighborhood types in explaining travel behavior in Chinese cities. The findings from this review should be relevant for researchers interested in developing future studies that will further advance geographic knowledge of the built environment and travel behavior, specifically in China and with broader global contexts.},

Along the same line, the recent availability of large-scale human mobility and communication data has offered novel quantitative insights hinting at a strong geographical confinement of human interactions within neighboring regions, extending to local levels within countries. However, models of human interaction largely ignore this effect. Here, we analyze several country-wide networks of telephone calls - both, mobile and landline - and in either case uncover a systematic decrease of communication induced by borders which we identify as the missing variable in state-of-the-art models. Using this empirical evidence, we propose an alternative modeling framework that naturally stylizes the damping effect of borders. We show that this new notion substantially improves the predictive power of widely used interaction models. This increases our ability to understand, model and predict social activities and to plan the development of infrastructures across multiple scales.},

In the mid-20th century, architect and planner Josep Lluis Sert wondered if cities could survive; in the early 21st century we see that cities have not only survived but have grown as never before. Cities today are engines of production and trade, forges of scientific and technological innovation and crucibles of social change. Urbanisation is a major driver of change in contemporary societies; it is a process that involves acute social inequalities and serious environmental problems, but also offers opportunities to move towards a future of greater prosperity, environmental sustainability and social justice.

Rather, shared mobility services should be designed and integrated with other transport modes having carbon emission reduction as an explicit optimisation goal.

	abstract = {Transportation planners have long recognized that it is urgent to integrate emerging spatial analysis with travel behavior studies. A clearer understanding of the spatial interactions among travelers and the complex environment they face has the potential to reap benefits of the ongoing technologies of travel behavior, spatial analysis and Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS).
Considering that spatial patterns have been overlooked in the literature of travel behavior and ATIS, the main objective of this research is to use robust methods of spatial analysis to enhance the understanding of how the associations between traveler decisions, built environment and socio-demographic characteristics are organized spatially. This dissertation takes a significant step towards filling this gap by using innovative spatial data description methods, e.g. geo-imputation, dynamic buffer analysis, spatial statistics to model the travel behavior of both the general population and university students.
This study starts by developing a unique database from extensive behavioral data combined with a variety of spatial measurements, taking advantage of increased GIS capabilities. Five different activity-based databases from different regions are used, combined with their related socio-demographic and land use data. Among them are two general population travel surveys from North Carolina, which were conducted in Charlotte and at the Greater Triangle in 2003 and 2006, respectively. The Virginia Add-on for the general population was conducted in 2008, while two waves of the Virginia University Student Travel Survey (USTS) were conducted in 2009 and 2010. The general population and the university students are compared with each other in terms of how they traveled and responded to ATIS.
Issues addressed in this dissertation include two aspects. The first one is how to describe data in space more accurately. When there is a need to know the exact locations of residences (geo-coordinate), but such information is unknown, geo-imputation is used as a fundamental method of assigning synthetic locations randomly to these residences based on available zonal information. After locating the residences by using geo-imputation, dynamic buffer analysis is used to capture locally built environment characteristics around residences, which place emphasis on capturing accessibility.
The second issue is modeling travel behavior in space. Particular emphasis is placed on modeling associations between trip making, trip decision changes and their associated explanatory variables. The general population is compared with the university students who represent an energetic and technology-savvy subgroup of the population. Different spatial scales are used for these two groups: the regional level is used for the general population; the university campus is used as a special trip generator for the university students.
At the regional level, a unique model structure, i.e. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), is used to allow associations to change across space, referred to as spatial heterogeneity. Significant spatial heterogeneity is found in the associations between trip-making and built environment, as well as in the model of travelers' information acquisition behavior and their travel decision adjustments. The spatial heterogeneity in the trip-making models suggests that there is higher spatial variability in favor of the statement that better land use design can help reduce auto trips. It is important to note that these potentially useful insights would have remained uncovered if using a non-spatial model that does not take spatial heterogeneity into account.
At the special trip generator level, when local models don't work well, the university campus is studied as a case which represents a combination of livable environments and a group of people who have different life cycles compared with the general population. Particular spatial analysis is applied to capture the association between trip-making and students' residential proximity to campus. The models confirm there are rings of mobility around the campus. Different from the traditional travel demand model for the general population, this varied level of mobility of students based on their residential proximity of campus is important and must be considered in the students' travel demand model.},

	abstract = {This dissertation offers a new theoretical and methodological framework for understanding segregation in spatio-temporal terms as a separation of activity spaces, the spaces people move through as they go about their daily activities. The framework is a set of indexes with which multiple dimensions of activity-space segregation can be measured and compared across cities. The indexes are designed to capture socially relevant information about differences in the places people frequent, the people with whom they come into contact, and the nature of their movement. In designing the indexes, the dissertation extends the existing areal unit indexes of residential segregation, draws on an early formulation of White's spatial proximity index, and identifies existing measures of individual activity space from the geography and ecology literature. For each index, the dissertation develops an estimator that may be used to draw inferences from sample data, and it evaluates the performance of the estimator at different sample sizes and under different geographic and demographic conditions. To do this, it relies on a combination of high resolution activity-space trajectories collected from volunteers all over the world through a mobile phone application, and simulated trajectories of the full populations of two U.S. cities. The dissertation concludes that the proposed areal unit measures of activity-space segregation may be estimated with minimal bias using coarse trajectory data but require large samples of people and the implementation of a bootstrap bias correction technique. The proposed extension of White's spatial proximity index, on the other hand, may be estimated without bias using coarse trajectory data from relatively small samples of people. The proposed measures of individual activity spaces require high resolution trajectory data, but may be estimated without bias using relatively small samples of people.},

	abstract = {Changing the design aspects of urban form is a positive approach to improving transportation. Land use and urban design strategies have been proposed to not only to bring about changes in travel behavior but as a way of providing a better quality of life to the residents. While the research on the relationship between urban form and travel behavior has been pretty extensive, there is a clear gap in the explicit consideration of the underlying transportation network, even though researchers acknowledge its importance. This dissertation aims to continue on the research interest in understanding travel behavior while explicitly accounting for the underlying transportation network structure.
Transportation networks have an underlying structure, defined by the layout, arrangement and the connectivity of the individual network elements, namely the road segments and their intersections. The differences in network structure exist among and between networks. This dissertation argues that travelers perceive and respond to these differences in underlying network structure and complexity, resulting in differences in observed travel patterns. This hypothesized relationship between network structure and travel is analyzed in this dissertation using individual and aggregate level travel and network data from metropolitan regions across the U.S. Various measures of network structure, compiled from existing sources, are used to quantify the structure of street networks. The relation between these quantitative measures and travel is then identified using econometric models.
The underlying principle of this research is that while the transportation network is not the only indicator of urban form and travel, an understanding of the transportation network structure will provide a good framework for understanding and designing cities. The importance of such an understanding is critical due to the long term and irreversible nature of transportation network decisions. The comprehensive analyses presented in this dissertation provide a clear understanding of the role of network design in influencing travel.},

	abstract = {This study presents an analytical model of the interaction between urban form and the demand for transit travel, in which residential location, transit demand, and the spatial dispersion of non-work activities are endogenously determined. In this model, travel demand is considered a derived demand brought about by the necessity to engage in out-of-home activities whose geographical extent is affected by urban form. In a departure from the urban monocentric model, residential location is defined as a job-residence pair in an urban area in which jobs, residences, and non-work activities are dispersed. Transit demand is then determined by residential location, work trips, non-work trip chains, and goods consumption.
Theoretically derived hypotheses are empirically tested using a dataset that integrates travel and land-use data. There is evidence of a significant influence of land-use patterns on transit patronage. In turn, transit demand affects consumption and non-work travel. Although much reliance has been placed on population density as a determinant of transit demand, it is found here that population density does not have a large impact on transit demand and, moreover, that the effect decreases when residential location is endogenous. To increase transit use, urban planners have advocated a mix of residential and commercial uses in proximity to transit stations. In this study, it is found that the importance of transit-station proximity is weakened by idiosyncratic preferences for residential location. In addition, when population density and residential location are jointly endogenous, the elasticity of transit demand with respect to walking distance to a transit station decreases by about 33 percent over the case in which these variables are treated an exogenous.
The research reported here is the first empirical work that explicitly relates residential location to trip chaining in a context in which individuals jointly decide residential location and the trip chain. If is found that households living farther from work use less transit and that trip-chaining behavior explains this finding. Households living far from work engage in complex trip chains and have, on average, a more dispersed activity space, which requires reliance on more flexible modes of transportation. Therefore, reducing the spatial allocation of non-work activities and improving transit accessibility at and around subcenters would increase transit demand. Similar effects can be obtained by increasing the presence of retail locations in proximity to transit-oriented households. Although focused on transit demand, the framework can be easily generalized to study other forms of travel.},

	abstract = {Flourishing economy, rapid industrialization and increasing trend of motorization have been shaping societies in the developing countries like India in an unprecedented manner. Infrastructure backlog amid such rapid growth in all imaginable directions has heavily exacerbated the urban transport crisis in these countries by alarming increase in vehicular travel demand, road fatalities, and environmental pollution. To address urban transport challenges, the necessary development and implementation of effective transport planning and policies have generally lagged in the developing countries compared to that seen in the developed countries due to several constraints including resource constraints, knowledge constraints, institutional constraints and so on. However, in the recent past, with the rapid development seen by several emerging economies and the explosive growth in transportation infrastructure investment, there is a growing interest in the development and implementation of advanced travel demand modeling systems in developing countries. But lack of necessary research and exploration of travel behavior in a developing country context has left very limited knowledge for us to understand the extent of applicability of these advanced theories and methodologies in a different socio-cultural perspective. Assessing the practical relevance of the subject, this research adopts a comprehensive approach to explore the activity engagement pattern and time use behavior from a developing country standpoint. To accomplish this goal, a series of empirical and analytical studies are performed on a household travel survey data set available from Thane Metropolitan Area in India. The study also introduces new concepts and facilitates enhancements of existing modeling methodologies in the field of travel behavior and time use research. The study results provide very insightful findings and plausible interpretations consistent with a developing country perspective recognizing a wide spectrum of differences and similarities in activity patterns and time use behavior between a developed and a developing country. Specified model structures are meaningfully able to incorporate various socio-cultural and institutional constraints and reflected sensitivity to the behavioral variability between the contexts suggesting that advanced analytical techniques may be satisfactorily applied on the data set from developing countries which may contribute important ingredients in the development of advanced activity-based model system in the countries like India.},

	abstract = {In recent years the introduction of location-based services in online social networks have provided unprecedented amount of public-generated data on human movements and activities. This novel data source is available for free and provides a new dimension of information related to human activities with greater details. Investigating urban activity pattern is crucial for understanding the driving force behind human movements in urban areas. Most of previous studies focus on understanding and modeling human mobility using data collected from mobile phones, bank notes movements, and subway smart-card transactions. However, these studies fail to link human movements with their purposes (activities). Although other studies use the combination of mobile phone data and Point of Interest (POI) data collected from internet, the information from POI for each place does not necessarily correspond to the actual activity that individual is participating in. In this research, the location-based information ("check-ins") shared in an online social media, i.e., Twitter, is used to explore and interpret the aggregate level urban activity pattern. With detailed activity categories in each data record, we are able to discover more realistic and detailed description of human dynamics and urban activity characteristics.
The first goal of this research is to investigate the urban aggregate level activity pattern. In this work, the individual check-in behavior is analyzed, which shows that the individual number of check-ins follows a truncated power law distribution and the individual radius of gyration follows a Weibull distribution. The temporal characteristics are also investigated, which reveals distinct patterns in different activity categories. In order to study the data at more detailed level, a virtual grid is constructed by dividing the city map into square cells at the size of 200 by 200 meters. Using the grid system, we can visualize the spatial distribution of popular places, and compute the site ranking distribution for the cells. These spatial distributions show important features about the unique activity patterns for each city. The kernel density estimation technique is also applied to reveal the evolution of activity centers in both time and space. Same analysis is conducted in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco, where city level activity patterns are compared. The findings show the existence of underlying laws and patterns that govern human urban activities, which enhance our understanding about the urban dynamics and human movement in the urban area.
The second goal of this study is to explore the possibility of using this new type of data to infer the urban land use. A new approach of using unsupervised clustering algorithm and social media check-in data is proposed. Data is aggregated and normalized by time periods and activity categories for each cell. K-means algorithm is then used to cluster all the cells into four classes. Optimal number of clusters and empirical verification confirm that this approach can effectively predict the residential, commercial, open space and recreation sites with reasonable accuracy. This shows the potential of using large scale geo-location data in urban land use inference.},

	abstract = {Today's mobile information society depends increasingly on the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as mobile phones. A thorough understanding of the correlation between mobile phone usage and human mobility will help in predicting people's mobility patterns and therefore provide important guidelines for maintaining sustainable transportation, updating environmental policies, and designing early warning and emergency response systems.
This dissertation develops a generalizable framework for extracting and characterizing human mobility patterns from georeferenced mobile phone datasets. It begins with analyzing the different types of information that can be stored in mobile phone datasets. Extended human mobility models and data mining methodologies are developed for spatio-temporal knowledge discovery based on mobile phone data. These models provide the basis for investigating and quantifying the correlation between human physical travel, communication travel, and environmental structure from two perspectives: individual-oriented and urban-oriented. This research also addresses issues of uncertainty, which arise from the natural variability of human mobility, the inaccuracy and imprecision of recorded trajectories, and the imperfection of the underlying models. Finally, a large dataset of northeast China is utilized for a comprehensive evaluation of the developed methods and models and the correlation between spatial structure, human mobility patterns, and mobile phone usage. The intellectual merits of this research include a generalization UML model, algorithms to model movement patterns, and various empirical studies. The results of this research will provide references for policy makers and urban planners to understand the characteristics of individual mobility with wide spread ICT usage, as well as updating environmental and transportation policies.
This research enhances our understanding of the relationship between human mobility and ICT in general, and between human mobility patterns and mobile phone usage in particular. In addition, it advances conventional geographic knowledge discovery by focusing on knowledge extraction from sparse datasets with low resolution and individual attributes. The case study from northeast China allows us to examine the influence of mobile phone usage in a highly populated and rapidly developing country.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Research on the variability in travel behavior, i.e. how individuals repeat or change their travel behavior over time, has a long history. An understanding of variability not only facilitates behavior modeling efforts but also provides insights into the complex factors underpinning people's travel behaviors. Previous studies of behavioral variability have mostly concentrated on non-spatial aspects. This dissertation contributes to the existing literature by examining the spatial variability of activity location choices. Activity locations are a set of spatially dispersed places where individuals perform activities. They play a critical role in structuring human travels, as individuals' demand for travelling in space is derived from the demand for activity participation. Specifically, two research questions are of interest: 1) how is location variability affected by time-of-day? 2) how can the knowledge of location variability be used to inform the development of location prediction models? Analyses are performed with a mobile phone data set consisting of the traces of 120,435 individuals over two months. Significant time-of-day dependence of location variability is identified. Time-of-day effect is found to take account for 36\% of the total variations in location variability. The results emphasize the importance of time-of-day in shaping one's location choice behavior and provide a basis for future modeling efforts on location variability. Location variability is found to be an instrumental indicator of the amount of input information required for location prediction. Specifically, given 100 historical (not necessarily unique) locations, an accuracy level marginally over 80\% can be achieved for people with low location variability. In contrast, for those individuals with a high level of location variability, prediction accuracy can hardly reach 50\% with 100 historical locations. This finding has significant implications on making more efficient location predictions. It will allow us to customize the amount of information input in location prediction for subpopulations differing in location variability by removing redundant information. Being able to discard some data without compromising model prediction accuracy is one way to deal with an overwhelming amount of data.},

However, how to measure transportation accessibility in different areas have been limited to data availability and technology. Recently, with increasing availability in public transportation data, we found a gap between current methods and large volume of data now available. This thesis developed a new method to measure multi-mode transportation data, including taxi, bus, and subway. Based on this measurement, we can visualize and understand the spatiotemporal patterns of accessibility in New York City (NYC). With historical travel records and public transit schedule, Relative Index (RI) is developed in this thesis to measure and compare the differences in the accessibility in NYC. RI distribution patterns during different time periods were also compared and analyzed for more information about transportation in NYC. By the end of this thesis, a practical application that measured accessibility for nine major hospitals in NYC was provided. Results in this thesis showed that subways have more impacts about accessibility than bus. Also, service frequency during different time of a day has affect accessibility.},

	abstract = {This dissertation focuses on the key role that big data can play in minimizing the perceived disconnect between social theory and quantitative methods in the discipline of geography. It takes as its starting point the geographic concept of space, which is conceptualized very differently in social theory versus quantitative methodology. Contrary to this disparity, an examination of the disciplinary history reveals a number of historic precedents and potential pathways for a rapprochement, especially when combined with some of the new possibilities of big data. This dissertation also proposes solutions to two common barriers to the adoption of big data in the social sciences: accessing and collecting such data and, subsequently, meaningful analysis. These methods and the theoretical foundation are combined in three case studies that show the successful integration of a quantitative research methodology with social theories on space. The case studies demonstrate how such an approach can create new and alternative understandings of urban space. In doing so it answers three specific research questions: (1) How can big data facilitate the integration of social theory on space with quantitative research methodology? (2) What are the practical challenges and solutions to moving {\textquotedblleft}beyond the geotag{\textquotedblright} when utilizing big data in geographical research? (3) How can the quantitative analysis of big data provide new and useful insight in the complex character of social space? More specifically, what insights does such an analysis of relational social space provide about urban mobility and cognitive neighborhoods?

	abstract = {Urban Informatics is the practice of using computer technology to support core city functions: planning, governance and operations. This technology consists of hardware, software, databases, sensors, and communication devices used to develop and sustain more livable and healthier cities. Urban Informatics provides governments with the tools to make data-driven decisions regarding long-term plans, predict and respond to current and upcoming situations, and even help with day-to-day tasks such as monitoring water use and waste processing. New and immense location-aware datasets formally defined in this thesis as Spatial Big Data are emerging from a variety of sources and can be used to find novel and interesting patterns for use in urban informatics. Spatial big data is the key component driving the emerging field of Urban Informatics at the intersection of people, places, and technology. However, spatial big data presents challenges for existing spatial computing systems to store, process, and analyze such large datasets. With these challenges come new opportunities in many fields of computer science research, such as spatial data mining and spatial database systems. This thesis contains original research on two types of spatial big data, each study focusing on a different aspect of handling spatial big data (storage, processing, and analysis).
To address the challenge of analysis of spatial big data, we studied the problem of finding primary corridors in bicycle GPS datasets. Given a set of GPS trajectories on a road network, the goal of the All-Pair Network Trajectory Similarity (APNTS) problem is to calculate the similarity between all trajectories using the Network Hausdorff Distance. This problem is important for a variety of societal applications, such as facilitating greener travel via bicycle corridor identification. The APNTS problem is challenging due to the high cost of computing the exact Network Hausdorff Distance between trajectories in spatial big datasets. Previous work on the APNTS problem takes over 16 hours of computation time on a real-world dataset of bicycle GPS trajectories in Minneapolis, MN. In contrast, this work focuses on a scalable method for the APNTS problem using the idea of row-wise computation, resulting in a computation time of less than 6 minutes on the same datasets. We provide a case study for transportation services using a data-driven approach to identify primary bicycle corridors for public transportation by leveraging emerging GPS trajectory datasets. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic data show a two orders of magnitude improvement over previous work.
To address the challenge of storage of spatial big data, we studied the problem of storing spatio-temporal networks in spatial database systems. Given a spatio-temporal network and a set of database query operators, the goal of the Storing Spatio-Temporal Networks (SSTN) problem is to produce an efficient data storage method that minimizes disk I/O access costs. Storing and accessing spatio-temporal networks is increasingly important in many societal applications such as transportation management and emergency planning. This problem is challenging due to strains on traditional adjacency list representations when storing temporal attribute values from the sizable increase in length of the time-series. Current approaches for the SSTN problem focus on orthogonal partitioning (e.g., snapshot, longitudinal, etc.), which may produce excessive I/O costs when performing traversal-based spatio-temporal network queries (e.g., route evaluation, arrival time prediction, etc) due to the desired nodes not being allocated to a common page. We propose a Lagrangian-Connectivity Partitioning (LCP) technique to efficiently store and access spatio-temporal networks that utilizes the interaction between nodes and edges in a network. Experimental evaluation using the Minneapolis, MN road network showed that LCP outperforms traditional orthogonal approaches.
The work in this thesis the first step toward understanding the immense challenges and novel applications of Spatial Big Data Analytics for Urban Informatics. In this thesis, we define spatial big data and propose novel approaches for storing and analyzing two popular spatial big data types: GPS trajectories and spatio-temporal networks. We conclude the thesis by exploring future work in the processing of spatial big data.},

	abstract = {Human activity follows an approximately 24-hour day-night cycle, but there is significant individual variation in awake and sleep times. Individuals with circadian rhythms at the extremes can be categorized into two chronotypes: "larks", those who wake up and go to sleep early, and "owls", those who stay up and wake up late. It is well established that a person's chronotype can affect their activities and health. However, less is known on the effects of chronotypes on the social behavior, even though it is evident that social interactions require coordinated timings. To study how chronotypes relate to social behavior, we use data collected using a smartphone app on a population of more than seven hundred volunteer students to simultaneously determine their chronotypes and social network structure. We find that owls maintain larger personal networks, albeit with less time spent per contact. On average, owls are more central in the social network of students than larks, frequently occupying the dense core of the network. Owls also display strong homophily, as seen in an unexpectedly large number of social ties connecting owls to owls.},

We do this using GPS traces from 604 individuals participating in a multi year long experiment, The Copenhagen Networks study. Earlier works, focusing on the prediction of a participant{\textquoteright}s whereabouts in the next time bin, have found very high upper limits ({\textbackslash}(\{\&gt;\}90{\textbackslash}\%{\textbackslash})). We show that these upper limits are highly dependent on the choice of a spatiotemporal scales and mostly reflect stationarity, i.e. the fact that people tend to \textit{not} move during small changes in time. This leads us to propose an alternative approach, which aims to predict the next location, rather than the location in the next bin. Our approach is independent of the temporal scale and introduces a natural length scale. By removing the effects of stationarity we show that the predictability of the next location is significantly lower (71\%) than the predictability of the location in the next bin.},

	abstract = {With the rise of smart cities people are moving within urban spaces and still be able to pervasively interact with information, services, city{\textquoteright}s resources and other people. In such a highly connected scenario, smartphones and other wireless portable devices are carried by humans, exhibit the same mobility behaviour of their human carriers and their movements strongly impact on the underlying network operation and performance. The understanding of human mobility in an urban space has become crucial to optimize the network management, to plan the adaptive allocation of critical resources and ensure constant quality of the user experience. This paper takes a first step in the direction of the design of a mobility model meeting behavioural and scale requirements of modern smart cities. We envision a smart city as a collection of places, each representing a Point of Interest (PoI) with specific value for single individuals and for a set of them. As a consequence, each individual has his/her own mobility footprint, while few of them share similar mobility patterns. By simulating the mobility of each individual across city{\textquoteright}s places, we will be able to properly describe human mobility and social behaviour in urban spaces, and to extract all needed information about how city{\textquoteright}s resources and services are accessed. The extensive use of CDR, GPS and WiFi traces, enables us to analyse the characteristics of city's Points of Interest (PoI), classify them for each individual according to their importance and study how the individuals move across them. The common features observed are the key points to build a metropolitan mobility simulator able to reproduce the regularity in spatio-temporal behaviour of mobile users and also how city sociality is built around PoIs of the city. The simulator exhibits high flexibility and can be applied in wide geographical and population scales.},

In our approach, human mobility patterns are analysed from trajectories which are generated by hikers. We propose the generation of the trail network identifying special points in the overlap of trajectories. Trail crossings and trailheads define our network and shape topological features. We analyse the trail network of Balearic Islands, as a case of study, using complex weighted network theory. The analysis is divided into the four seasons of the year to observe the impact of weather conditions on the network topology. The number of visited places does not decrease despite the large difference in the number of samples of the two seasons with larger and lower activity. It is in summer season where it is produced the most significant variation in the frequency and localization of activities from inland regions to coastal areas. Finally, we compare our model with other related studies where the network possesses a different purpose. One finding of our approach is the detection of regions with relevant importance where landscape interventions can be applied in function of the communities.},

	abstract = {Land cover change (LCC) can have a significant impact on human and environmental well-being. LCC maps derived from historical remote sensing (RS) images are often used to evaluate the impacts of past LC changes and to construct models to predict future LC changes. Free moderate spatial resolution ({\textasciitilde}30m) optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RS imagery is now becoming increasingly available for this LCC monitoring. However, the classification algorithms used to extract LC information from these images typically require {\textquotedblleft}training data{\textquotedblright} for classification (i.e. points or polygons with LC class labels), and acquiring this labelled training data can be difficult and time-consuming. Alternatively, crowdsourced geographic data (CGD) has become widely available from online sources like OpenStreetMap (OSM), and it may provide a useful source of training data for LCC monitoring. A major challenge with utilizing CGD for LCC mapping, however, is the presence of class labelling errors, and these errors can vary spatially (e.g. due to differing levels of CGD contributor expertise) and temporally (e.g. due to time lag between CGD creation and RS imagery acquisition). In this study, we investigated a new LCC mapping method which utilizes free Landsat (optical) and PALSAR mosaic (SAR) satellite imagery in combination with labelled LC data extracted from CGD sources (the OSM {\textquotedblleft}landuse{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}natural{\textquotedblright} polygon datasets). A semi-unsupervised classification approach was employed for the LCC mapping to reduce the effects of class label noise in the CGD. The main motivation and benefit of the proposed method is that it does not require training data to be manually collected, allowing for a faster and more automated assessment of LCC. As a case study, we applied the method to map LCC in the Laguna de Bay area of the Philippines over the 2007{\textendash}2015 period. The LCC map produced using our proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 90.2\%, providing evidence that CGD and multi-temporal/multi-sensor satellite imagery, when combined, have a great potential for LCC monitoring.},

In this paper the model SAFE (sustainability assessment by fuzzy evaluation) that was first developed to define and measure the sustainability of countries, is modified to assess the sustainability of cities worldwide. Overall sustainability is a function of two main inputs, ecological and well-being. The ecological input depends on the state of air, land and water and the well-being input on the state of the economy, education, health and civic environment of cities. SAFE uses 46 basic inputs to rank 106 cities according to sustainability. The number of inputs can be changed according to need. A sensitivity analysis identifies those basic inputs or indicators that affect sustainability the most. If such inputs are improved, the sustainability of cities improves the fastest. It turns out that European cities occupy the highest ranking positions whereas African, Asian, and South American cities the lowest. Waste generation and GHG (greenhouse gases) emissions are the main problems for cities in the developed world, whereas crime and poverty are the main problems in cities of developing countries.},

The distance between two data samples traditionally depends on the values of their attributes (coordinates) in a data space. Some metrics also take into account the distribution of samples within the space (e.g. local densities) aiming to improve potential classification or clustering performance. In this paper, we suggest the Social Distance metric that can be used on top of any traditional metric. For a pair of samples x and y, it averages the two numbers: the place (rank), which sample y holds in the list of ordered nearest neighbors of x; and vice versa, the rank of x in the list of the nearest neighbors of y. Average is a contraharmonic Lehmer mean, which penalizes the difference between the numbers by giving values greater than the Arithmetic mean for the unequal arguments. We consider normalized average as a distance function and we prove it to be a metric. We present several modifications of such metric and show that their properties are useful for a variety of classification and clustering tasks in data spaces or graphs in a Geographic Information Systems context and beyond.},

	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays on urban structure, housing, and environment. The first paper contributes to the existing debate on the co-location hypothesis by devising a proximity measure and controlling for a set of other urban form measures. Multiple regression analysis revealed that job-worker proximity leads to shorter commuting time. In addition, results from subareas suggested that the impact of job-worker imbalance and the impact of job-worker mismatch on the commuting time are both greater in the suburb in comparison with the city center. The second paper examines the impact of the LIHTC construction on nearby housing prices in the Boston metropolitan area by using the AITS-DID method. The paper found that the price gap between the LIHTC micro-neighborhood and the area beyond is reduced by approximately 16.5 percent points after the LIHTC construction. The segmentation of the analysis by sub-region showed spatially heterogeneous results. The findings from this research are contrary to the conventional perception that subsidized housing developments lead to neighborhood decline persistently. Measuring resilience to natural hazards is a central issue in the hazard mitigation sciences. The third paper applied a confirmatory factor methodology to operationalize the biophysical, built environment, and socioeconomic resilience dimensions for local jurisdictions in large urban metropolitan areas in South Korea. The factor covariances showed a trade-off relationship between natural infrastructure and human activities. Densely developed and affluent urban areas tend to lack biophysical resilience. Some local governments, sorted into the same groups, turn out to be located in different metropolitan areas. The spatial variation and inequality in the resilience dimensions suggest the necessity of integrated and flexible governance for sustainable hazard mitigation.},

	url = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107084},
	abstract = {This dissertation is a collection of three essays on urbanization and migration. The first essay is a treatment on the urbanization theory. I discuss the ambiguity in the urban concept, and propose a comprehensive urban concept which includes the demographic, physical, economic, social, and cultural dimensions of urban characteristics. Based on the concept, and through analyses of the countries' preference over specific urban definition methods, I propose the Kuznets Curve for urban definition complexity, and the Hypothesis of the Unbalanced Urbanization Process. I test the hypothesis with a case study of five countries: the United States, Mexico, China, India, and Ethiopia. With the findings I call for a paradigm shift in the study of the urbanization process, which constitutes the general framing of the dissertation. The next two essays concern the application of the framework in a specific country - China, and relevant studies on the country's internal migration. The studies are based on two nation-wide, large-sample surveys on the migrants and rural households' living conditions in 2008-2009 (n=2398) and 2014-2015 (n=2097). In the second essay, I study the life-cycle migration behavior pattern of China's internal rural-urban migrants. I first conduct a statistical treatment of the general demographics as well as individual-level migration-related behavioral patterns of the migrants, and then reconstruct the life history of the migrants through survival analyses on their migrating and return migrating behaviors, and also two Cox proportional hazard models respective to the two survival processes which examine the determinants of such behaviors. Results give rise to an overlapping generational and iterative pattern of the migrants' migration behavior with a filtration mechanism, which I call "the Circle of Life" model. Lastly, in the third essay, I examine the role of China's institutional environment in shaping the unique migration behavior pattern. I conduct a thorough documentation on the evolution, and especially the recent development of China's Hukou (household registration) and land ownership policies, and show the shift of a dual social structure as a result of the policy change. Furthermore, I develop two groups of discrete choice models to examine the formation of the migrants' urban settlement intentions. Overall, I conclude that China's institutions have played an empowering function, thus giving rise to an institution-bound rational choice behavior concerning migration and settlement. Lastly, I briefly discuss the implications of the findings on urbanization and development theories, as well as the policy suggestions.},

Such data, however, lack semantic information such as the interaction of individuals with the transportation modes available. On the other hand, traditional mobility surveys provide detailed snapshots of the relation between socio-demographic characteristics and choice of transportation modes. Transportation mode detection is currently approached using features such as speed, acceleration and direction either on their own or in combination with GIS data. Combining such information with socio-demographic characteristics of travellers has the potential of offering a richer modelling framework that could facilitate better transportation mode detection using variables such as age and disability. In this paper, we explore the possibility to include both elements of the environment and individual characteristics of travellers in the task of transportation mode detection. Using dynamic Bayesian Networks, we model the transition matrix to account for such auxiliary data by using an informative Dirichlet prior constructed using data from traditional mobility surveys. Results have shown that it is possible to achieve comparable accuracy with the most widely used classification algorithms while having a rich modelling framework, even in the case of sparse mobility data.},

	abstract = {News articles capture a variety of topics about our society. They reflect not only the socioeconomic activities that happened in our physical world, but also some of the cultures, human interests, and public concerns that exist only in the perceptions of people. Cities are frequently mentioned in news articles, and two or more cities may co-occur in the same article. Such co-occurrence often suggests certain relatedness between the mentioned cities, and the relatedness may be under different topics depending on the contents of the news articles. We consider the relatedness under different topics as semantic relatedness. By reading news articles, one can grasp the general semantic relatedness between cities; yet, given hundreds of thousands of news articles, it is very difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to manually read them. This paper proposes a computational framework which can {\textquoteleft}read{\textquoteright} a large number of news articles and extract the semantic relatedness between cities. This framework is based on a natural language processing model and employs a machine learning process to identify the main topics of news articles. We describe the overall structure of this framework and its individual modules, and then apply it to an experimental dataset with more than 500,000 news articles covering the top 100 US cities spanning a 10-year period. We perform exploratory visualizations of the extracted semantic relatedness under different topics and over multiple years. We also analyze the impact of geographic distance on semantic relatedness and find varied distance decay effects. The proposed framework can be used to support large-scale content analysis in city network research.},

	abstract = {Through the perspective of tourism, a city as a tourist destination usually consists of multiple tourist attractions such as natural or cultural scenic spots. These attractions scatter in city spaces following some specific forms: clustered in some regions and dispersed in others. It is known that users organize their tours in a city not only according to the distance between different attractions but also according to other factors such as time constraints, expenses, interests, and the similarities between different attractions. Hence, users' travel tours can help us gain a better understanding about the relationships among different attractions at the city scale. In this paper, a methodological framework is developed to detect tourists' spatial-temporal behaviors from social media data, and then such information is used to extract and analyze city's tourism districts. We believe that this city space division will make significant contributions to the fields of urban planning, tourism facility providing, and scenery area constructing.

The first several PCs are the most common patterns of passengers{\textquoteright} variation over time among all metro stations, while the corresponding elements in the eigenvectors, referred to as EigenStation in this paper, can describe the characteristics of the metro station. The decomposition result is evaluated at both the aggregation and individual station levels, and the result demonstrates that the first two elements of the EigenStation can approximate the original dataset. The EigenStation vector angle, i.e., $\omega$, is used to represent the structure of the EigenStation, and its value is highly related to the land use structure around the metro stations. The proposed method can provide deep insight into static and dynamic urban spaces, which can help improve urban planning around metro stations.},

	abstract = {Massive datasets that capture human movements and social interactions have catalyzed rapid advances in our quantitative understanding of human behavior during the past years. One important aspect affecting both areas is the critical role space plays. Indeed, growing evidence suggests both our movements and communication patterns are associated with spatial costs that follow reproducible scaling laws, each characterized by its specific critical exponents. Although human mobility and social networks develop concomitantly as two prolific yet largely separated fields, we lack any known relationships between the critical exponents explored by them, despite the fact that they often study the same datasets. Here, by exploiting three different mobile phone datasets that capture simultaneously these two aspects, we discovered a new scaling relationship, mediated by a universal flux distribution, which links the critical exponents characterizing the spatial dependencies in human mobility and social networks. Therefore, the widely studied scaling laws uncovered in these two areas are not independent but connected through a deeper underlying reality.},

In this survey we review major characteristics of human mobility studies including from trajectory-based studies to studies using graph and network theory. In trajectory-based studies statistical measures such as jump length distribution and radius of gyration are analyzed in order to investigate how people move in their daily life, and if it is possible to model this individual movements and make prediction based on them. Using graph in mobility studies, helps to investigate the dynamic behavior of the system, such as diffusion and flow in the network and makes it easier to estimate how much one part of the network influences another by using metrics like centrality measures. We aim to study population flow in transportation networks using mobility data to derive models and patterns, and to develop new applications in predicting phenomena such as congestion. Human Mobility studies with the new generation of mobility data provided by cellular phone networks, arise new challenges such as data storing, data representation, data analysis and computation complexity. A comparative review of different data types used in current tools and applications of Human Mobility studies leads us to new approaches for dealing with mentioned challenges.},

The existing literature is limited in accuracy when predicting spatial temporal travels from built environment. Understanding the scaling laws of spatial visitation frequency sheds new light on the issue. The scaling laws connect travel and the built environment by ordered-rankings, which make it possible to predict the number of arrivals from environmental variables. This research analyses the scaling laws of dynamic spatial visitation frequency using taxis' global positioning system (GPS) records, and proposes a model to predict spatial temporal arrivals from points of interest (POIs). The results show that: (i) the scaling law of spatial visitation frequency is exponential; (ii) the exponential scaling law is explained by the linear preferential attachment effect and a logarithmic travel growth process; (iii) the exponential scaling law is not sensitive to time; (iv) the proposed model predicts spatial temporal arrivals with high accuracy (R2 \&gt; 0.6).},

The geographic projections of the emerging areas in a few recent studies on single regions have been suggested to share two distinct properties: first, they are cohesive, and second, they tend to closely follow socio-economic boundaries and are similar to existing political regions in size and number. Here we use an extended set of countries and clustering indices to quantify overlaps, providing ample additional evidence for these observations using phone data from countries of various scales across Europe, Asia, and Africa: France, the UK, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, and Ivory Coast. In our analysis we use the known approach of partitioning country-wide networks, and an additional iterative partitioning of each of the first level communities into sub-communities, revealing that cohesiveness and matching of official regions can also be observed on a second level if spatial resolution of the data is high enough. The method has possible policy implications on the definition of the borderlines and sizes of administrative regions.},

It is shown that the degree distribution in this network has a power-law degree distribution k - 5 and that the probability that two customers are connected by a link follows a gravity model, i.e. decreases as d - 2 , where d is the distance between the customers. We also consider the geographical extension of communication triangles and we show that communication triangles are not only composed of geographically adjacent nodes but that they may extend over large distances. This last property is not captured by the existing models of geographical networks and in a last section we propose a new model that reproduces the observed property. Our model, which is based on the migration and on the local adaptation of agents, is then studied analytically and the resulting predictions are confirmed by computer simulations.},

We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

We then construct a null model for the occurrence of temporal motifs that takes into account the interaction frequencies and connectivity between nodes of different colors. This null model allows us to detect significant patterns in call sequences that cannot be observed in a static network that uses interaction frequencies as link weights. We find sex-related differences in communication patterns in a large dataset of mobile phone records and show the existence of temporal homophily, the tendency of similar individuals to participate in communication patterns beyond what would be expected on the basis of their average interaction frequencies. We also show that temporal patterns differ between dense and sparse neighborhoods in the network. Because also this result is independent of interaction frequencies, it can be seen as an extension of Granovetter{\textquoteright}s hypothesis to temporal networks.},

Here we use empirical data on human mobility, captured by mobile-phone traces, to show that the predictions of the CTRW models are in systematic conflict with the empirical results. We introduce two principles that govern human trajectories, allowing us to build a statistically self-consistent microscopic model for individual human mobility. The model accounts for the empirically observed scaling laws, but also allows us to analytically predict most of the pertinent scaling exponents.},

The problem arises from the convention of spatially defining migration as the crossing of administrative borders. Because administrative regions vary in size, shape, and settlement patterns, it is difficult to tell how far movers go, raising doubts about the generalizability of research in the field. This article shows that satellite data on nighttime lights can be used to infer accurate measures of migration distance. We first use the intensity of nighttime lights to locate mean population centers that closely correspond to mean population centers calculated from actual population data. Until now, locating mean population centers accurately has been problematic, as it has required highly disaggregated population data, which are lacking in many countries. The nighttime lights data, which are freely available on a yearly basis, solve this challenge. We then show that this information can be used to accurately estimate migration distances.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present methods to estimate average daily origin{\textendash}destination trips from triangulated mobile phone records of millions of anonymized users. These records are first converted into clustered locations at which users engage in activities for an observed duration. These locations are inferred to be home, work, or other depending on observation frequency, day of week, and time of day, and represent a user{\textquoteright}s origins and destinations. Since the arrival time and duration at these locations reflect the observed (based on phone usage) rather than true arrival time and duration of a user, we probabilistically infer departure time using survey data on trips in major US cities. Trips are then constructed for each user between two consecutive observations in a day. These trips are multiplied by expansion factors based on the population of a user{\textquoteright}s home Census Tract and divided by the number of days on which we observed the user, distilling average daily trips. Aggregating individuals{\textquoteright} daily trips by Census Tract pair, hour of the day, and trip purpose results in trip matrices that form the basis for much of the analysis and modeling that inform transportation planning and investments. The applicability of the proposed methodology is supported by validation against the temporal and spatial distributions of trips reported in local and national surveys.},

	abstract = {While social scientists have invested a lot of energy in exploring the uneven distribution of social groups in the city, they have surprisingly limited their efforts to investigating social segregation at the place of residence. The present paper investigates social segregation over the 24 h a day in the Paris region, taking into account how social groups move within a city throughout the day.
From a large and precise daily travel survey carried out in the Paris region (EGT 2010) among 25,500 respondents aged 16 or over, we have computed segregation indices and maps hour by hour from respondents' educational and socioprofessional indicators. We then observed that social segregation within the Paris region decreases during the day and that the most segregated group (the upper class group) during the night remains the most segregated during the day. We also explored how the co-presence between various social groups evolves throughout the day. Finally, we highlighted some large variations in districts' social composition over 24 h: districts with similar social composition during the night can differ deeply in their social composition during the day-time because of socially selective daily trips.
Exploring social segregation around the clock helps in considering more dynamically place effects on individual behavior and targeting areas to implement interventions more connected with the real city rhythm.},

In this paper the transportation aspect of social media is investigated and reviewed. A detailed discussion is provided about how social media data from different sources can be used to indirectly and with minimal cost extract travel attributes such as trip purpose, mode of transport, activity duration and destination choice, as well as land use variables such as home, job and school location and socio-demographic attributes including gender, age and income. The evolution of the field of transport and travel behaviour around applications of social media over the last few years is studied. Further, this paper presents results of a qualitative survey from travel demand modelling experts around the world on applicability of social media data for modelling daily travel behaviour. The result of the survey reveals positive view of the experts about usefulness of such data sources.},

	abstract = {The knowledge of human mobility is an integral component of several different branches of research and planning, including delay tolerant network routing, cellular network planning, disease prevention, and urban planning. The uncertainty associated with a person's movement plays a central role in movement predictability studies. The uncertainty can be quantified in a succinct manner using entropy rate, which is based on the information theoretic entropy. The entropy rate is usually calculated from past mobility traces. While the uncertainty, and therefore, the entropy rate depend on the human behavior, the entropy rate is not invariant to spatial resolution and sampling interval employed to collect mobility traces. The entropy rate of a person is a manifestation of the observable features in the person's mobility traces. Like entropy rate, these features are also dependent on spatio-temporal quantization. Different mobility studies are carried out using different spatio-temporal quantization, which can obscure the behavioral differences of the study populations. But these behavioral differences are important for population-specific planning. The goal of dissertation is to develop a theoretical model that will address this shortcoming of mobility studies by separating parameters pertaining to human behavior from the spatial and temporal parameters.},

Many supervised classification methods have been proposed in the OBIC framework. However, most did not use deep learning methods. In this paper, a new deep-learning-based OBIC framework is introduced. First, we segment the original image into objects by graph-based minimal-spanning-tree segmentation algorithm. Second, we extract the spectral, spatial, and texture features for each object. Then we put all features into stacked autoencoders (SAE) or stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) network, and trained the parameters of the network using training samples. Finally, all objects were classified by the network. Based on our SAE/SDAE OBIC framework, we achieved 97\% overall accuracy when classifying an UAV image into five categories. In addition, our experiment shows that our framework increases overall accuracy by approximately 6\% when compared to the linear support vector machine (linear SVM) and radial basis function kernel support vector machine (RBF SVM) algorithms when sufficient training samples are lacking.},

Does the role of spatial context influence the distributional dynamics of the two systems? Finally we examine if there is a distinct international border region that displays inequality dynamics different from those of the internal regions of the two national systems. Strong evidence of spatial heterogeneity in regional income mobility is found between the two national systems, with Mexico having higher mobility relative to the US. The international border region is found to have distinct mobility dynamics from either national system, experiencing the strongest mobility. Extensive evidence of spatial contextual effects are found throughout the US-Mexican pooled data set indicating that a region's transitional dynamics are influenced by incomes of neighboring regions.},

In this respect, the use of social media data for analyzing entrepreneurial networks represents a promising research domain. Not only does the user profile of social media users overlap substantially with the profile of entrepreneurs, but research highlights that the entrepreneurial process is a fundamentally networked activity. Given this research promise, this study analyzes digitally mediated interactions using Twitter data collected about a variety of actors engaged in entrepreneurial networks for the United States over an eighteen-month period. Analytical results reveal that the hashtags used in this analysis (\#smallbiz and \#entrepreneur) do capture (albeit not exhaustively) well-known actors in entrepreneurial networks, as well as important subtleties in the geography of locales engaged in these networks. The article closes with an agenda for big data research on entrepreneurship that highlights the important role of geographers in unraveling these networked geographies given the complexities of ground-truthing geographic information from big data sources.},

While recent work has made great progress extracting valid and useful measurements from new data resources, few present end-to-end solutions that transform and integrate raw, massive data into estimates of travel demand and infrastructure performance. Here we present a flexible, modular, and computationally efficient software system to fill this gap. Our system estimates multiple aspects of travel demand using call detail records (CDRs) from mobile phones in conjunction with open- and crowdsourced geospatial data, census records, and surveys. We bring together numerous existing and new algorithms to generate representative origin{\textendash}destination matrices, route trips through road networks constructed using open and crowd-sourced data repositories, and perform analytics on the system{\textquoteright}s output. We also present an online, interactive visualization platform to communicate these results to researchers, policy makers, and the public. We demonstrate the flexibility of this system by performing analyses on multiple cities around the globe. We hope this work will serve as unified and comprehensive guide to integrating new big data resources into customary transportation demand modeling.},

	abstract = {In today's era of big data, huge amounts of spatial-temporal data are generated daily from all kinds of citywide infrastructures. Understanding and predicting accurately such a large amount of data could benefit many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for prediction of spatial-temporal activities such as human mobility, especially the inflow and outflow of people in urban environments based on existing large-scale mobility datasets. Our methodology first identifies and quantifies the latent characteristics of different spatial environments and temporal factors through tensor factorization. Our hypothesis is that the patterns of spatial-temporal activities are highly dependent on or caused by these latent spatial-temporal features. We model this hidden dependent relationship as a Gaussian process, which can be viewed as a distribution over the possible functions to predict human mobility. We tested our proposed methodology through experiments conducted on a case study of New York City's taxi trips and focused on the mobility patterns of spatial-temporal inflow and outflow across different spatial areas and temporal time periods. The results of the experiments verify our hypothesis and show that our prediction methodology achieves a much higher accuracy than other existing methodologies.},

As the human driver recognises travel-times rather than distances, faster roads appear to be {\textquoteleft}shorter{\textquoteright} than slower ones. The resulting metric space has an effective dimension $\delta$ \&gt; 2 , which is a significant measure of the heterogeneity of road speeds. We found that traffic strongly concentrates on only a small fraction of the roads. The distribution of vehicular flows over the roads obeys a power law, indicating a clear hierarchical order of the roads. Studying the cellular structure of the areas enclosed by the roads, the distribution of cell sizes is scale invariant as well.},

	abstract = {Dense and mixed land-use configurations are assumed to encourage high and prolonged activity levels, which in turn are considered to be important for the condition of urban neighbourhoods. We used mobile phone usage data recorded in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as a proxy for urban activity to test whether the density in different forms of urban land use increases the level of activity in urban areas, and whether mixed land uses can prolong high levels of activity in an area. Our results indicate that higher densities correspond with higher activity levels, mixed land uses do indeed diversify urban activity dynamics and colocating particular land uses prolongs high activity levels in the evening hours. We proceed to demonstrate that mixed activity provisions and high urban activity levels coincide with urban neighbourhoods that are considered attractive places in which to live and work, while lower activity levels and markedly low activity mixes coincide with neighbourhoods that are considered disadvantaged.

	abstract = {Big Data is the term being used to describe a wide spectrum of observational or {\textquotedblleft}naturally-occurring{\textquotedblright} data generated through transactional, operational, planning and social activities that are not specifically designed for research. Due to the structure and access conditions associated with such data, their use for research and analysis becomes significantly complicated. New sources of Big Data are rapidly emerging as a result of technological, institutional, social, and business innovations. The objective of this background paper is to describe emerging sources of Big Data, their use in urban research, and the challenges that arise with their use. To a certain extent, Big Data in the urban context has become narrowly associated with sensor (e.g., Internet of Things) or socially generated (e.g., social media or citizen science) data. However, there are many other sources of observational data that are meaningful to different groups of urban researchers and user communities. Examples include privately held transactions data, confidential administrative micro-data, data from arts and humanities collections, and hybrid data consisting of synthetic or linked data. The emerging area of Urban Informatics focuses on the exploration and understanding of urban systems by leveraging novel sources of data. The major potential of Urban Informatics research and applications is in four areas: (1) improved strategies for dynamic urban resource management, (2) theoretical insights and knowledge discovery of urban patterns and processes, (3) strategies for urban engagement and civic participation, and (4) innovations in urban management, and planning and policy analysis. Urban Informatics utilizes Big Data in innovative ways by retrofitting or repurposing existing urban models and simulations that are underpinned by a wide range of theoretical traditions, as well as through data-driven modeling approaches that are largely theory agnostic, although these divergent research approaches are starting to converge in some ways. The paper surveys the kinds of urban problems being considered by going from a data-poor environment to a data-rich world and the ways in which such enquiries have the potential to enhance our understanding, not only of urban systems and processes overall, but also contextual peculiarities and local experiences. The paper concludes by commenting on challenges that are likely to arise in varying degrees when using Big Data for Urban Informatics: technological, methodological, theoretical/epistemological, and the emerging political economy of Big Data.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the value that data from mobile phone providers can bring into urban analysis. The novel argument is that the pervasiveness of mobile phone telephony has transformed mobile phones from a communications device to a tool for socio-spatial research. Put simply, mobile phone providers can potentially gather relevant data on a very refined spatio-temporal scale for every 85 out of 100 inhabitants in the world. Such data can include basic information about personal communication patterns, interactions and mobility which can enable researchers to better understand spatial human behavior, the predictability of which is well documented. These advances that have mostly taken place in the complexity science domain, which largely focuses on individual behavioural patterns, can also result in applications in the spatial analysis domain. This paper has two aims. Firstly, we critically discuss the existing state of the art of urban analysis based on big data from mobile phone operators. Based on this review, the paper takes a methodological turn to present some preliminary urban analysis results using data from a mobile phone operator in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.},

Three different types of mobile phone data were employed in the analysis of complex temporal and spatial patterns. The first data type concerns the mobile phone traffic registered by the network over the entire Lombardy Region (Northern Italy). Data are expressed in Erlang, a measure of the density of calls. The second typology of data consists in localized and aggregated tracks of anonymized mobile phone users . It is an origin-destination datum derived from the Call Detail Record database. The third type of data refers to the mobile switching centre (MSC), which is the primary service delivery node for GSM, responsible for routing voice calls and text messages. With the maps based on the processing of the three types of mobile phone data, it was possible to offer information on temporary populations and city usage patterns (daily/nightly practices, non-systematic mobility).},

Here, we present a population-weighted opportunities model without any adjustable parameters to capture the underlying driving force accounting for human mobility patterns at the city scale. We use various mobility data collected from a number of cities with different characteristics to demonstrate the predictive power of our model. We find that insofar as the spatial distribution of population is available, our model offers universal prediction of mobility patterns in good agreement with real observations, including distance distribution, destination travel constraints and flux. By contrast, the models that succeed in modelling mobility patterns in countries are not applicable in cities, which suggests that there is a diversity of human mobility at different spatial scales. Our model has potential applications in many fields relevant to mobility behaviour in cities, without relying on previous mobility measurements.},

	abstract = {Daily activity-travel sequences of individuals have been estimated by activity-based transportation models. The sequences serve as a key input for travel demand analysis and forecasting in the region. However, the high cost along with other limitations inherent to traditional travel data collecting methods has hampered the models{\textquoteright} further advancement and application, particularly in developing countries. With the wide deployment of mobile phone devices today, we explore the possibility of using mobile phone data to build such a travel demand model. Our exploration consists of four major steps. First, home, work and other stop locations for each user are identified, based on their mobile phone records. All the obtained locations along with their particular orders on a day are then formed into stop-location-trajectories and classified into clusters. In each cluster, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is subsequently constructed, which characterizes the probabilistic distribution of activities and their related travel of the sequences. Finally, the derived models are used to simulate travel sequences across the entire employed population.
Using data collected from natural mobile phone usage of around 9 million users in Senegal over a period of one year, we evaluated our approach via a set of experiments. The average length of daily sequences drawn from the stop-location-trajectories and the simulated results is 4.55 and 4.72, respectively. Among all the 677 types of the stop-location-trajectories, 520 (e.g. 76.8\%) are observed from the simulated sequences, and the correlation of sequence frequency distribution over all the types between these two sequence sets is 0.93. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing the probabilistic distribution of activity locations and their sequential orders revealed by the mobile phone data, contributing towards the development of new, up-to-date and cost-effective travel demand modelling approaches.},

Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, $\beta$, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have $\beta$ ?1.2 {\textgreater}1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display $\beta$ ?0.8 {\textless}1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which $\beta${\textless}1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

Cities are complex systems of which functioning depends upon many social, economic, and environmental factors. Bettencourt (p. 1438; see the cover; see the Perspective by Batty) developed a theory to explain the quantitative relationships observed between various aspects of cities and population size or land area.
Despite the increasing importance of cities in human societies, our ability to understand them scientifically and manage them in practice has remained limited. The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies.
Cities of all sizes can be modeled as interdependent networks of interactions and infrastructure. [Also see Perspective by Batty]

	abstract = {The year 2014 marked the rapid expansion of big data in urban studies and planning practices in China. Big data has advantages of revealing individual characteristics rather than a general feature by traditional statistics, and it is consistent with the idea of people-oriented urbanization and urban{\textendash}rural planning. The research progress of big data since 2000 in China is reviewed in this paper. Focusing on behavior big data mining and big data application in urban studies and planning practices, the review is proposed from four parts, involving behavior data acquisition \&amp; analysis, spatial analysis, plan making \&amp; management application and new methodologies with big data. Lastly, some open research issues such as potential challenges and possible directions of development are discussed.},

	abstract = {Characterizing how people move through space has been an important component of many disciplines. With the advent of automated data collection through GPS and other location sensing systems, researchers have the opportunity to examine human mobility at spatio-temporal resolution heretofore impossible. However, the copious and complex data collected through these logging systems can be difficult for humans to fully exploit, leading many researchers to propose novel metrics for encapsulating movement patterns in succinct and useful ways. A particularly salient proposed metric is the mobility entropy rate of the string representing the sequence of locations visited by an individual. However, mobility entropy rate is not scale invariant: entropy rate calculations based on measurements of the same trajectory at varying spatial or temporal granularity do not yield the same value, limiting the utility of mobility entropy rate as a metric by confounding inter-experimental comparisons. In this paper, we derive a scaling relationship for mobility entropy rate of non-repeating straight line paths from the definition of Lempel-Ziv compression. We show that the resulting formulation predicts the scaling behavior of simulated mobility traces, and provides an upper bound on mobility entropy rate under certain assumptions. We further show that this formulation has a maximum value for a particular sampling rate, implying that optimal sampling rates for particular movement patterns exist.},

Urban mobility is characterised by highly dynamic spatial-temporal variability not detected by census or surveys. Mobile phones allow tracking of the population, giving information about their time{\textendash}space location. A multi-city population mobility study was carried out in seven main Italian large metropolitan areas for 2 months (1st March to 30th April, 2015), starting from high-resolution gridded population data derived from mobile phone traffic data. Mean daily{\textendash}nightly variations of population density were calculated during weekdays with increments of population of about 25\% on average and peaks up by 200\% in hotspot areas. Strong spatial gradients were identified with both accumulation and depletion of population in urban zones of geographical dimensions of 55 and 44\%, respectively, of the municipality areas on average. Larger metropolitan areas, such as Rome, Milan, and Turin, show the highest increments of population, while medium-sized cities (e.g., Bari and Palermo) exhibit lower values and weaker gradients of variation of population. By means of a developed mobility factor, three main mobility phenomena (morning and evening commuting, diffuse mobility) occurring during weekdays were identified and characterized.},

A shortcoming of this method is that it does not generate expression details such as the wrinkles due to skin deformations. In this paper, we provide a solution to this problem. We have developed a geometry-driven facial expression synthesis system. Given feature point positions (the geometry) of a facial expression, our system automatically synthesizes a corresponding expression image that includes photorealistic and natural looking expression details. Due to the difficulty of point tracking, the number of feature points required by the synthesis system is, in general, more than what is directly available from a performance sequence. We have developed a technique to infer the missing feature point motions from the tracked subset by using an example-based approach. Another application of our system is expression editing where the user drags feature points while the system interactively generates facial expressions with skin deformation details.},

In this paper, we analyze the behavioral similarities and differences between the use of formal 3-1-1 phone services and informal channels {\textendash} like Twitter {\textendash} to report about issues that affect a community. Our end objective is to help public institutions understand the relevance of informal communication channels as data sources for service requests. For that purpose, we design and evaluate a set of supervised classifiers that automatically label tweets as complaints and determine its type. A weighted multiclass classifier was selected based on its performance with precision and recall values of 86\% and 62\%, respectively. By comparing labeled tweets against official 3-1-1 phone service request records, we provide a large-scale analysis of citizen complaint behaviors over the two crowdsourced channels.},

They leave their working cities and return their hometowns to enjoy annual family time, and back to cities after the holiday. In this study, with the massive location-based data collected from millions of smartphone users, we propose a novel method to trace the migration flow and explore the migration patterns of Chinese people. From the temporal perspective, we explore the migration trend over time during a 34-days period, about half a month before and after the Spring Festival. From the spatial perspective, the migration directions and routes are estimated and quantified, and the migration flow is visualized. The spatial range of influence of developed regions could be reflected with the destinations of migration, the migration destinations and originations have obvious characteristic of geographical proximity.},

	abstract = {Searching for generic behaviors has been one of the driving forces leading to a deep understanding and classification of diverse phenomena. Usually a starting point is the development of a phenomenology based on observations. Such is the case for power law distributions encountered in a wealth of situations coming from physics, geophysics, biology, lexicography as well as social and financial networks. This finding is however restricted to a range of values outside of which finite size corrections are often invoked. Here we uncover a universal behavior of the way in which elements of a system are distributed according to their rank with respect to a given property, valid for the full range of values, regardless of whether or not a power law has previously been suggested. We propose a two parameter functional form for these rank-ordered distributions that gives excellent fits to an impressive amount of very diverse phenomena, coming from the arts, social and natural sciences. It is a discrete version of a generalized beta distribution, given by f(r) = A(N+1-r)b/ra, where r is the rank, N its maximum value, A the normalization constant and (a, b) two fitting exponents. Prompted by our genetic sequence observations we present a growth probabilistic model incorporating mutation-duplication features that generates data complying with this distribution. The competition between permanence and change appears to be a relevant, though not necessary feature. Additionally, our observations mainly of social phenomena suggest that a multifactorial quality resulting from the convergence of several heterogeneous underlying processes is an important feature. We also explore the significance of the distribution parameters and their classifying potential. The ubiquity of our findings suggests that there must be a fundamental underlying explanation, most probably of a statistical nature, such as an appropriate central limit theorem formulation.},

We analyze the trip behaviors of users across time and different regions in the park to find patterns of co-location and shared time and, thus, potential social interaction.

Using a density-based clustering technique we extract 1.215 frequent destinations of \~{}150.000 user movements from a large e-mobility database. We query available context information from Foursquare, a popular location-based social network, to enrich the destinations with semantic background. As GPS measurements can be noisy, often more then one possible destination is found and movement patterns vary over time. Therefore we present highly interactive visualizations that enable an analyst to cope with the inherent geospatial and behavioral uncertainties.},

This approach creatively transforms the geographic coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) to street names reflecting contextual semantic information. Consequently, the movement of each taxi is studied as a document consisting of the taxi traversed street names, which enables semantic analysis of massive taxi data sets as document corpora. Hidden themes, namely taxi topics, are identified through textual topic modeling techniques. The taxi topics reflect urban mobility patterns and trends, which are displayed and analyzed through a visual analytics system. The system integrates interactive visualization tools, including taxi topic maps, topic routes, street clouds and parallel coordinates, to visualize the probability-based topical information. Urban planners, administration, travelers, and drivers can conduct their various knowledge discovery tasks with direct semantic and visual assists. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by case studies using a large taxi trajectory data set acquired from 21,360 taxis in a city.},

	abstract = {Understanding human movements and their interactions with the built environment has long been a research interest in transport geography. In recent years, two important types of urban mobility datasets {\textemdash} smart card transactions and taxi GPS trajectories {\textemdash} have been used extensively but often separately to quantify travel patterns as well as urban spatial structures. Despite the fruitful research outcomes, the relationships between different types of transport flows in the same geographic area remain poorly understood. In this research, we propose an analytical framework to compare urban mobility patterns extracted from these two data sources. Using Singapore as a case study, this research introduces a three-fold comparative analysis to understand: (1) the spatial distributions of public transit and taxi usages and their relative balance; (2) the distance decay of travel distance, and (3) the spatial interaction communities extracted from the two transport modes. The research findings reveal that the spatial distributions of travel demand extracted from the two transport modes exhibit high correlations. However, more in-depth analysis (based on rank-size distribution and log odds ratio) reveals a higher degree of spatial heterogeneity in public transit usage. The travel distance of trips from public transit decays faster than that of taxi trips, highlighting the importance of taxis in facilitating long-distance travels. Both types of trips decay much faster when travel distance is beyond 20km, which corresponds to the average distance from the urban periphery to the center. The spatial interaction communities derived from public transit are different on weekdays and weekends, while those of taxis show similar patterns. Both transport modes yield communities that reveal the city{\textquoteright}s polycentric structure, but their differences indicate that each of the transport modes plays a specific role in connecting certain places in the city. The study demonstrates the importance of comparative data analytics to urban and transportation research.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, human activities and movements are recorded by a variety of tools, forming different trajectory sets which are usually isolated from one another. Thus, it is very important to link different trajectories of one person in different sets to provide massive information for facilitating trajectory mining tasks. Most prior work took advantages of only one dimensional information to link trajectories and can link trajectories in a one-to-many manner (providing several candidate trajectories to link to one specific trajectory). In this paper, we propose a novel approach called one-to-one constraint trajectory linking with multi-dimensional information (OCTL) that links the corresponding trajectories of one person in different sets in a one-to-one manner. We extract multidimensional features from different trajectory datasets for corresponding relationships prediction, including spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal information, which jointly describe the relationships between trajectories. Using these features, we calculate the corresponding probabilities between trajectories in different datasets. Then, we formulate the link inference problem as a bipartite graph matching problem and employ effective methods to link one trajectory to another. Moreover, the advantages of our approach are empirically verified on two real-world trajectory sets with convincing results.},

Cities are likely to play an increasingly significant role in improving energy efficiency and decreasing emissions, and constitute platforms of vital importance with respect to the development of global culture, economy, innovation, investment, and partnership. It can therefore be said that cities are the main engines of social, economic, and technological development. The geographical distribution of urban populations will continue to change, as the regions where the changes are occurring are likely to shift in the future. Moreover, although urbanisation in the first half of the twentieth century was concentrated predominantly in Europe (IEA 2008), recent trends indicate an unprecedented wave of urbanisation within the boundaries of Asia.},

With rapid urbanisation, there is a growing need for sustainable urbanisation. As a consequence, considerable focus is being placed on compact cities namely, cities of short distances in which there are higher residential and population densities, greater mixed land-use and an urban design amenable to walking and cycling. Importantly, research is pointing to enhanced health outcomes associated with compact cities as a consequence of energy efficiency and reduced emissions as residents are more likely to live closer to amenities and walk, cycle or use public transport. However, although urban density is an important dimension of urban form and structure, it acts in a complex way with other social and morphological features to shape cities, human behaviour and population health. To respond to the complexity of twenty-first century cities, robust decision tools and platforms will be necessary to assist policymakers and key city-stakeholders deliver sustainable future cities.},

These increasing mobility data provide potential opportunities to enhance the understanding of human mobility behaviors. Several trajectory data mining approaches have been proposed to benefit from these rich datasets, but fail to incorporate aspatial semantics in mining. This study investigates mining frequent moving sequences of geographic entities with transit time from geo-tagged data. Different from previous analysis of geographic feature only trajectories, this work focuses on extracting patterns with rich context semantics. We extend raw geographic trajectories generated from geo-tagged data with rich context semantic annotations, use regions-of-interest as stops to represent interesting places, enrich them with multiple aspatial semantic annotations, and propose a semantic trajectory pattern mining algorithm that returns basic and multidimensional semantic trajectory patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that semantic trajectory patterns from our method present semantically meaningful patterns and display richer semantic knowledge.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in the systematic scientific understanding of cities and urbanization due to an increase in data availability about many aspects of urban life throughout the world, as well as ready access to more powerful computation and modeling capabilities. Cities are manifestly complex systems in that social, economic, health and other aspects of urban processes are interconnected in the lives of each urban dweller and depend on the nature of urban services and infrastructure over their built environments. Despite this truism, the modeling of cities as complex systems across all these interdependent dimensions is relatively new. This paper presents a primer to different modeling approaches to cities and urbanization, pointing out their realms of applicability as well as critical areas where they are currently insufficient. Specifically, I give a short introduction to five main traditions{\textemdash}agent-based, spatial equilibrium, contagion, life-course and growth models{\textemdash}and discuss how they are becoming increasingly articulated and interdependent to create more realistic and more predictive models of cities. From this perspective, I summarize a research agenda for urban theory and modeling focused on understanding issues of growth and development across scales of organization from individuals to neighborhoods, cities and urban systems.},

Hence, capturing the temporal influence is necessary to ensure the high performance in a POI recommendation system.

Moreover, an Aggregated Temporal Tensor Factorization (ATTF) model for POI recommendation is proposed to capture the three temporal features.

Whether recommended locations meet users{\textquoteright} interests depends on three factors: user preference, social influence, and geographical influence. Especially, capturing the geographical influence plays the most important role for POI recommendations. Previous studies observe that checked-in locations disperse around several centers and employ Gaussian distribution based models to approximate users{\textquoteright} check-in behaviors. Yet centers discovering methods are not satisfactory in prior work. This chapter shows how to exploit Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and genetic algorithm based Gaussian mixture model (GA-GMM) to capture geographical influence. Experimental results on a real-world LBSN dataset show that GMM beats several popular geographical capturing models in terms of POI recommendation, while GA-GMM excludes the effect of outliers and enhances GMM.},

Here we investigate the impact of human movement on the spatial spread of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Southern Thailand during a recent re-emergence. We hypothesised that human movement, population density, the presence of habitat conducive to vectors, rainfall and temperature affect the transmission of CHIKV and the spatiotemporal pattern of cases seen during the emergence. We fit metapopulation transmission models to CHIKV incidence data. The dates at which incidence in each of 151 districts in Southern Thailand exceeded specified thresholds were the target of model fits. We confronted multiple alternative models to determine which factors were most influential in the spatial spread. We considered multiple measures of spatial distance between districts and adjacency networks and also looked for evidence of long-distance translocation (LDT) events. The best fit model included driving-distance between districts, human movement, rubber plantation area and three LDT events. This work has important implications for predicting the spatial spread and targeting resources for control in future CHIKV emergences. Our modelling framework could also be adapted to other disease systems where population mobility may drive the spatial advance of outbreaks.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed study of network evolution by analyzing four large online social networks with full temporal information about node and edge arrivals. For the first time at such a large scale, we study individual node arrival and edge creation processes that collectively lead to macroscopic properties of networks. Using a methodology based on the maximum-likelihood principle, we investigate a wide variety of network formation strategies, and show that edge locality plays a critical role in evolution of networks. Our findings supplement earlier network models based on the inherently non-local preferential attachment. Based on our observations, we develop a complete model of network evolution, where nodes arrive at a prespecified rate and select their lifetimes. Each node then independently initiates edges according to a "gap" process, selecting a destination for each edge according to a simple triangle-closing model free of any parameters. We show analytically that the combination of the gap distribution with the node lifetime leads to a power law out-degree distribution that accurately reflects the true network in all four cases. Finally, we give model parameter settings that allow automatic evolution and generation of realistic synthetic networks of arbitrary scale.},

	abstract = {The frequent appearance of empirical rank-frequency laws, such as Zipf{\textquoteright}s law, in a wide range of domains reinforces the importance of understanding and modeling these laws and rank-frequency distributions in general. In this spirit, we utilize a simple stochastic cascade process to simulate several empirical rank-frequency distributions longitudinally. We focus especially on limiting the process{\textquoteright}s complexity to increase accessibility for non-experts in mathematics. The process provides a good fit for many empirical distributions because the stochastic multiplicative nature of the process leads to an often observed concave rank-frequency distribution (on a log-log scale) and the finiteness of the cascade replicates real-world finite size effects. Furthermore, we show that repeated trials of the process can roughly simulate the longitudinal variation of empirical ranks. However, we find that the empirical variation is often less that the average simulated process variation, likely due to longitudinal dependencies in the empirical datasets. Finally, we discuss the process limitations and practical applications.},

A problem in characterizing activity spaces has been in integrating the time and space dimensions into the same analytical framework while maintaining an understandable graphical representation of the space-time geographies envisioned by Hagerstrand and others. The ellipse allows this, as well as providing several quantifiable measures to be used for analyzing and characterizing activity spaces and urban travel behavior. In the current application, analysis of variance is used to analyze the resulting elliptic variables of 653 travelers. The results indicate that home location and household size are important factors in determining activity space characteristics and that the ellipse variables provide a different and useful approach for understanding urban travel behavior.},

It was brought to the attention of geographers in an influential series of papers written by geographer Stan Openshaw in the 1980s and 1990s. Geocomputational methods can be used to demonstrate the nature and potential extent of this problem, in particular empirical settings, and the results of experiments and simulations have focused interest on the effects of within-area spatial distributions upon analysis. Understanding of MAUP makes an important contribution to balanced assessment of the quality of secondary datasets. MAUP is best thought of not as an empirical problem but as a theoretical requirement to hone statistics to the geographic context in which they are applied. The problem should not be considered in isolation, but rather as part of an overall research design.},

	abstract = {Bike-sharing systems are widely deployed in many major cities, while the jammed and empty stations in them lead to severe customer loss. Currently, operators try to constantly reposition bikes among stations when the system is operating. However, how to effectively reposition to minimize the customer loss in a long period remains unsolved. We propose a spatio-temporal reinforcement learning based bike reposition model to deal with this problem. Firstly, an inter-independent inner-balance clustering algorithm is proposed to cluster stations into groups. Clusters obtained have two properties, i.e. each cluster is innerbalanced and independent from the others. As there are many trikes repositioning in a very large system simultaneously, clustering is necessary to reduce the problem complexity. Secondly, we allocate multiple trikes to each cluster to conduct inner-cluster bike reposition. A spatio-temporal reinforcement learning model is designed for each cluster to learn a reposition policy in it, targeting at minimizing its customer loss in a long period. To learn each model, we design a deep neural network to estimate its optimal long-term value function, from which the optimal policy can be easily inferred. Besides formulating the model in a multi-agent way, we further reduce its training complexity by two spatio-temporal pruning rules. Thirdly, we design a system simulator based on two predictors to train and evaluate the reposition model. Experiments on real-world datasets from Citi Bike are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of our model.},

Beyond merely connectivity, it has been shown in recent years that social contagion exists in online interactions. Along this line of investigation, we are interested in the subtle and invisible social influence on real-world behavior across offline communication networks. In particular, we study how social influence propagates and triggers behavioral change, and how such effect expands deeply across the social network in a way similar to the physical phenomenon of ripples across the water. To this end, we analyze a large-scale one-month international event in Andorra using nation-wide mobile phone data, and investigate the change in the likelihood of attending the event for people that have been influenced by and are of different social distances from the attendees. Our results suggest that social influence exhibits the ripple effect, decaying across social distances from the source but persisting up to six degrees of separation in the social network. We further show that such influence decays as communication delay increases and communication intensity decreases, and that it is stronger among people who are more explorative geographically. Our findings may have important implications in a number of domains, such as marketing, public health, and social mobilizations.},

Approaches that can rapidly target subpopulations for surveillance and control are critical for enhancing containment and mitigation processes during epidemics.Using a real-world dataset from Ivory Coast, this work presents an attempt to unveil the socio-geographical heterogeneity of disease transmission dynamics. By employing a spatially explicit meta-population epidemic model derived from mobile phone Call Detail Records (CDRs), we investigate how the differences in mobility patterns may affect the course of a hypothetical infectious disease outbreak. We consider different existing measures of the spatial dimension of human mobility and interactions, and we analyse their relevance in identifying the highest risk sub-population of individuals, as the best candidates for isolation countermeasures. The approaches presented in this paper provide further evidence that mobile phone data can be effectively exploited to facilitate our understanding of individuals{\textquoteright} spatial behaviour and its relationship with the risk of infectious diseases{\textquoteright} contagion. In particular, we show that CDRs-based indicators of individuals{\textquoteright} spatial activities and interactions hold promise for gaining insight of contagion heterogeneity and thus for developing mitigation strategies to support decision-making during country-level epidemics.},

Recently, cell phone traces have been successfully used to model aggregated human mobility, in particular during natural disasters such as earthquakes or flooding. Climate-related environmental change brings a decline of productive agricultural land and livestock which will push rural residents to migrate. As a result, it also has the potential of causing changes in human mobility and cause migrations that have a wider and long standing impact. In this study, using anonymized and aggregated cell phone traces, we model the migrations that happened during a severe drought that happened in La Guajira, Colombia, in 2014. Our results indicate a linear reduction of the population of 10 percent during the 6 months considered for this study. Furthermore, predicting these migrations has about a 60\% success rate for both the total number of people that migrate and to where they migrate. We also introduce a modification of the Radiation model in order to capture weather as one of the factors driving mobility, showing a RSS and RMSE reduction of 4.5\% when compared with the standard models.},

It is assumed to be one of many manifestations of an underlying power law like Pareto{\textquoteright}s or Benford{\textquoteright}s, but contrary to popular belief, from a distribution of, say, city sizes and a simple random sampling, one does not obtain Zipf{\textquoteright}s law for the largest cities. This pathology is reflected in the fact that Zipf{\textquoteright}s Law has a functional form depending on the number of events N. This requires a fundamental property of the sample distribution which we call {\textquoteleft}coherence{\textquoteright} and it corresponds to a {\textquoteleft}screening{\textquoteright} between various elements of the set.

This would be a new departure for the measurement of social exclusion, which so far has relied either on aggregate measures of locations or cross-sectional data of individuals. The size of a person's activity space can only be estimated with information reflecting a longer time horizon. In this paper the six-week travel diary survey (Mobidrive) is used, which was conducted in two German cities in 1999. About 95\% of all local trips were coded for 300 respondents (about 45,000 trips). The paper develops three possible measurement approaches of increasing complexity (confidence ellipse, kernel density estimates, shortest paths networks). The analysis revealed that the main driver of the size of the activity spaces is the overall number of unique locations visited by the respondents and to a lesser extent, their socio-demographic characteristics. In particular, the groups most often consider to be at risk of social exclusion (female, lower income, elderly) did not show significantly different activity spaces.},

	abstract = {Information and communication technologies have opened the way to new solutions for urban mobility that provide better ways to match individuals with on-demand vehicles. However, a fundamental unsolved problem is how best to size and operate a fleet of vehicles, given a certain demand for personal mobility. Previous studies1{\textendash}5 either do not provide a scalable solution or require changes in human attitudes towards mobility. Here we provide a network-based solution to the following {\textquoteleft}minimum fleet problem{\textquoteright}, given a collection of trips (specified by origin, destination and start time), of how to determine the minimum number of vehicles needed to serve all the trips without incurring any delay to the passengers. By introducing the notion of a {\textquoteleft}vehicle-sharing network{\textquoteright}, we present an optimal computationally efficient solution to the problem, as well as a nearly optimal solution amenable to real-time implementation. We test both solutions on a dataset of 150 million taxi trips taken in the city of New York over one year
                  6
                . The real-time implementation of the method with near-optimal service levels allows a 30 per cent reduction in fleet size compared to current taxi operation. Although constraints on driver availability and the existence of abnormal trip demands may lead to a relatively larger optimal value for the fleet size than that predicted here, the fleet size remains robust for a wide range of variations in historical trip demand. These predicted reductions in fleet size follow directly from a reorganization of taxi dispatching that could be implemented with a simple urban app; they do not assume ride sharing7{\textendash}9, nor require changes to regulations, business models, or human attitudes towards mobility to become effective. Our results could become even more relevant in the years ahead as fleets of networked, self-driving cars become commonplace10{\textendash}14.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new tour-based mode choice model. The model is agent-based: both households and individuals are modelled within an object-oriented, microsimulation framework. The model is household-based in that inter-personal household constraints on vehicle usage are modelled, and the auto passenger mode is modelled as a joint decision between the driver and the passenger(s) to ride-share. Decisions are modelled using a random utility framework. Utility signals are used to communicate preferences among the agents and to make trade-offs among competing demands. Each person is assumed to choose the {\textquotedblleft}best{\textquotedblright} combination of modes available to execute each tour, subject to auto availability constraints that are determined at the household level. The household{\textquoteright}s allocations of resources (i.e., cars to drivers and drivers to ride-sharing passengers) are based on maximizing overall household utility, subject to current household resource levels. The model is activity-based: it is designed for integration within a household-based activity scheduling microsimulator. The model is both chain-based and trip-based. It is trip-based in that the ultimate output of the model is a chosen, feasible travel mode for each trip in the simulation. These trip modes are, however, determined through a chain-based analysis. A key organizing principle in the model is that if a car is to be used on a tour, it must be used for the entire chain, since the car must be returned home at the end of the tour. No such constraint, however, exists with respect to other modes such as walk and transit. The paper presents the full conceptual model and estimation results for an initial empirical prototype. Because of the complex nature of the model decision structure, choice probabilities are simulated from direct generation of random utilities rather than through an analytical probability expression.},

	abstract = {Personal data, generated and continuously collected by modern devices and online services, open new perspectives in human behavior understanding. They can characterize human behavior at a very fine and precise resolution, covering a huge variety of daily life, from communication and individual mobility to complex social phenomena and economic behaviors. While from the research point of view the collection of behavioral data has never been so cost-effective and unobtrusive, at the same time, from the applicative point of view, numerous applications supporting users{\textquoteright} needs have leveraged on the massive availability of personal data and the insights produced by human behavior comprehension. Nevertheless, this scenario also raises unprecedented risks affecting users{\textquoteright} privacy.
The high relevance and effectiveness of digital footprints in capturing and describing human behaviors establishes the basis of this work. In this thesis, we use behavioral personal data, collected online or from mobile phones, to understand human behavior with the aim to support users in their everyday lives, investigating aspects that can be turned into personal or societal value in real application scenarios. In our work, we approached our research problems in a comprehensive way by leveraging on real personal data continuously observed in daily-life.
In particular, in this dissertation we investigate three main problems. Firstly, we understand the attitudes of individuals towards personal mobile data disclosure by using both individual characteristics and dynamic behaviors related to communication and mobility, captured from mobile phones. Secondly, we predict the future health status of individuals, in terms of flu-like and cold symptoms, on the basis of a systematic characterization of their mobility behaviors derived from their mobile phones. Finally, we infer the formation of future links in individuals{\textquoteright} social circle on the basis of multiple information sources related to explicit and implicit relationships that users form.
The main insights resulting from our investigation can support a set of use cases, targeting individual and collective applications. Our findings, in terms of behaviors affecting the personal propensity towards data disclosure, can support a new generation of privacy-tools providing personalized feedback to users when tuning their sharing settings. The insights from our following study can provide individuals with personalized feedback about their health status and support decision-makers towards the adoption of preventive measures for public-health. Finally, our findings in terms of new social link predictions can provide users with more accurate recommendations in social networking applications.},

	abstract = {Research on moving objects and analysis of movement patterns in urban networks can help us evaluate urban land-use types. With the help of technologies such as global positioning systems, spatial information systems and spatial data the study of movement patterns is possible. By understanding and quantifying the patterns of pedestrian trajectories, we can find effects of and relations between urban land-use types and movements of pedestrians. Understanding urban land-use and their relationships with human activities has great implications for smart and sustainable urban development. In this study, we use the data of various urban land-use types and the trajectory of pedestrians in an urban environment. This paper presents a new approach for identifying busy urban land-use by semantic spatial trajectory in which urban land-uses are assessed according to the pedestrian trajectories. Undoubtedly, the extraction of popular urban land-uses and analysis of the association between popular places and the spatial and semantic movement allow us to improve the urban structure and city marketing system. In this regard, for semantic analysis of urban land-use, all stop points are extracted by a time threshold and they are enriched according to semantic information such as age, occupation, and gender. We examine if and how habits of using land-use types depend on qualities such as age, gender and occupation. For analysis of effects of various urban land-use types, all stop points near each urban land-use are detected. Determining what type of urban land-use cause pedestrian traffic and high absorption coefficient and what relation such high traffic has with semantic information such as age, occupation and gender. By clustering the stop points, the results indicate that stop at urban networks for each gender have a spatial correlation. Also, the results show that some urban land-use types have high traffic and we have a correlation with some semantic information such as age, gender and occupation.},

	abstract = {Smart card data derived from automatic fare collection (AFC) systems of public transit enable us to study resident movement from a macro perspective. The rhythms of traffic generated by different land uses differ, reflecting differences in human activity patterns. Thus, an understanding of daily ridership and mobility patterns requires an understanding of the relationship between daily ridership patterns and characteristics of stations and their direct environment. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated this relationship. This study aims to propose a framework of identifying urban mobility patterns and urban dynamics from a spatiotemporal perspective and pointing out the linkages between mobility and land cover/land use (LCLU). Relying on 1 month{\textquoteright}s transactions data from the AFC system of Nanjing metro, the 110 metro stations are classified into 7 clusters named as employment-oriented stations, residential-oriented stations, spatial mismatched stations, etc., each characterized by a distinct ridership pattern (combining boarding and alighting). A comparison of the peak hourly ridership of the seven clusters is conducted to verify whether the clustering results are reasonable or not. Finally, a multinomial logit model is used to estimate the relationship between characteristics of the local environment and cluster membership. Results show that the classification based on ridership patterns leads to meaningful interpretable clusters and that significant associations exist between local LCLU characteristics, distance to the city center and cluster membership. The analytical framework and findings may be beneficial for improving service efficiency of public transportation and urban planning.},

Being a complex problem, an integrated approach of numerical modeling coupled with geospatial techniques (such as remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS)) is required for simulation. In this paper, an integrated approach of flood assessment in coastal urban areas using numerical models and geospatial techniques are discussed and demonstrated with the help of two case studies. Two simulation models, viz. Integrated Flood Assessment Modeling (IFAM) and software packages from Hydrologic Engineering Center (HEC), viz.

The power of SM has spanned new fields of research, which harness the power to arrive at instantaneous decisions which are needed in disaster situations.

SoBigData integrates resources and creates an infrastructure where sharing data and methods among text miners, visual analytics researchers, socio-economic scientists, network scientists, political scientists, humanities researchers can indeed occur. The main concepts related to SoBigData Research Infrastructure are presented. These concepts support virtual and transnational (on-site) access to the resources. Creating and supporting research communities are considered to be of vital importance for the success of our research infrastructure, as well as contributing to train the new generation of data scientists. Furthermore, this paper introduces the concept of exploratory and shows their role in the promotion of the use of our research infrastructure. The exploratories presented in this paper represent also a set of real applications in the context of social mining. Finally, a special attention is given to the legal and ethical aspects.

	abstract = {Analysis of long-distance travel demand has become more relevant in recent times. The reason is the growing share of traffic induced by journeys related to remote activities, which are not part of daily life. In today{\textquoteright}s mobile world, these journeys are responsible for almost 50 percent of the overall traffic. Traditionally, surveys have been used to gather data needed for the analysis of travel demand. Due to the high response burden and memory issues, respondents are known to underreport the number of journeys. The question of the real number of long-distance journeys remains unanswered without additional data sources. This paper uses an alternative data source, mobile phone data, and compares its results for long-distance travel demand with the national household travel survey (Mikrozensus Verkehr 2015). We take a sample of mobile phone data covering 12 months, and identify the number of long-distance trips. The results indicate that the number of long-distance trips is close in these two data sources.},

Traditional studies have used travel survey data to investigate commuting from the aspects of commuting mode, efficiency and influence factors. Due to the limited sample size of these data, it is difficult to examine the large-scale commuting patterns of urban citizens, especially when exploring the spatial structure of commuting. This study attempts to understand the spatial structure characteristics generated by human commutes to work by using massive mobile phone datasets. A three-step workflow was proposed to accomplish this goal, which includes extracting the home and work locations of phone users, detecting the communities from the commuting network, and identifying the commuting convergence and divergence areas for each community. A case study of Shenzhen, China was implemented to determine the commuting structure. We found that there are thirteen communities detected from the commuting network and that some of the communities are in accordance with urban planning; moreover, spatial polycentric polygons exist in each community.

	abstract = {We show that energy concepts can contribute to the understanding of human travel behaviour. First, the average journey times for different modes of transport are inversely proportional to the energy consumption rates measured for the respective human physical activities. Second, when daily travel-time distributions for different modes of transport such as walking, cycling, bus or car travel are appropriately scaled, they turn out to have a universal functional relationship. This corresponds to a canonical-like energy distribution with exceptions for short trips, which can be theoretically explained. Combined, this points to a law of constant average energy consumption for the physical activity of daily travel. Applying these natural laws could help to improve long-term urban and transport planning.},

We analyse well-documented political corruption scandals in Brazil over the past 27 years, focusing on the dynamical structure of networks where two individuals are connected if they were involved in the same scandal. Our research reveals that corruption runs in small groups that rarely comprise more than eight people, in networks that have hubs and a modular structure that encompasses more than one corruption scandal. We observe abrupt changes in the size of the largest connected component and in the degree distribution, which are due to the coalescence of different modules when new scandals come to light or when governments change. We show further that the dynamical structure of political corruption networks can be used for successfully predicting partners in future scandals. We discuss the important role of network science in detecting and mitigating political corruption.},

This paper analyzes human mobility and the resulting dynamics in the network workload caused by three different types of large-scale events: a major soccer match, a rock concert, and a New Year{\textquoteright}s Eve celebration, which took place in a large Brazilian city. Our analysis is based on the characterization of records of mobile phone calls made around the time and place of each event. That is, human mobility and network workload are analyzed in terms of the number of mobile phone calls, their inter-arrival and inter-departure times, and their durations. We use heat maps to visually analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of the movement patterns of the participants of the large-scale event. The results obtained can be helpful to improve the understanding of human mobility caused by large-scale events. Such results could also provide valuable insights for network managers into effective capacity management and planning strategies. We also present PrediTraf, an application built to help the cellphone carriers plan their infrastructure on large-scale events.},

Scale-free community size spectra (i.e., size distributions regardless of species) are routinely observed in natural ecosystems and are the product of intra- and interspecies regulation of the relative abundance of organisms of different sizes. Intra- and interspecies distributions of body sizes are thus major determinants of ecosystems{\textquoteright} structure and function. We show experimentally that single-species mass distributions of unicellular eukaryotes covering different phyla exhibit both characteristic sizes and universal features over more than four orders of magnitude in mass. Remarkably, we find that the mean size of a species is sufficient to characterize its size distribution fully and that the latter has a universal form across all species. We show that an analytical physiological model accounts for the observed universality, which can be synthesized in a log-normal form for the intraspecies size distributions. We also propose how ecological and physiological processes should interact to produce scale-invariant community size spectra and discuss the implications of our results on allometric scaling laws involving body mass.},

	abstract = {Because of increasing global urbanization and its immediate consequences, including changes in patterns of food demand, circulation and land use, the next century will witness a major increase in the extent of paved roads built worldwide. To model the effects of this increase, it is crucial to understand whether possible self-organized patterns are inherent in the global road network structure. Here, we use the largest updated database comprising all major roads on the Earth, together with global urban and cropland inventories, to suggest that road length distributions within croplands are indistinguishable from urban ones, once rescaled to account for the difference in mean road length. Such similarity extends to road length distributions within urban or agricultural domains of a given area. We find two distinct regimes for the scaling of the mean road length with the associated area, holding in general at small and at large values of the latter. In suitably large urban and cropland domains, we find that mean and total road lengths increase linearly with their domain area, differently from earlier suggestions. Scaling regimes suggest that simple and universal mechanisms regulate urban and cropland road expansion at the global scale. As such, our findings bear implications for global road infrastructure growth based on land-use change and for planning policies sustaining urban expansions.},

Therefore, the ability to obtain valuable sets of data has become one of the key challenges for researchers. Traditional mobility surveys have many important limitations. In this situation, the potential of the use of smartphones and dedicated applications in the identification of individual travel behaviour seem very promising. We set ourselves a goal to indicate strengths and weaknesses of data obtained with this method and assess the perspectives of its use for the needs of public policies. For these purposes we prepared a low-cost mobile application and conducted a pilot study among students in Pozna{\'n} (Poland). In effect, trajectories of more than 100 people with almost 3 billion of location data were collected. Based on a literature review and our results we discuss the main problems, limitations and challenges of the broader use of the data obtained with smartphones. In the conclusion, we argue that there is a huge and increasing potential connected with mobile phones, but still some important barriers exist including sampling problems, limitations in big data analyses and technological issues. Therefore, a broader use of smartphones in travel behaviour surveys seems to be rather a distant perspective.},

The goal of this paper is to use {\textquotedblleft}attractiveness{\textquotedblright} as a medium to examine the similarity and differences of Social media data (SMD) and survey data in academic research, based on a case study of the Beijing Olympic Forest Park, in Beijing, China. SMD was extracted from two social media platforms and two surveys were conducted to assess the attractiveness of various locations and landscape elements. Data collection, keyword extraction and keyword prioritization were used and compared in the data gathering and analysis process. The findings revealed that SMD and survey data share many similarities. Both data sources confirm that natural ambience is more appreciated than cultural elements, particularly the naturalness of the park. Spaces of practical utility are more appreciated than facilities designed to have cultural meanings and iconic significance. Despite perceived similarities, this study concludes that SMD exhibits exaggerated and aggregated bias. This resulted from the intrinsic character of SMD as volunteered and unstructured data selected through an emotional process rather than from a rational synthesis. Exciting events were reported more often than daily experiences. Reflecting upon the strength and weakness of SMD and survey data, this study would recommend a combined landscape assessment process, which first utilizes SMD to build up an assessment framework, then applies conventional surveys for supplementary and detailed information. This would ultimately result in comprehensive understanding.},

The usefulness of our model is demonstrated with a case study of the Tianhe District in megacity Guangzhou, China. The model predicted building functions at 85\% accuracy based on ground truth data from field surveys. We further explored the spatial patterns of the identified building functions. Most mixed-use buildings are located along major streets. Our proposed model can identify mixed-use buildings in a city; information is useful for planning evaluation and urban policymaking.},

We describe an example of a scalable experiment exploiting these circumstances at a public, outdoor fair in Barcelona (Spain). Participants were tracked while wandering through an open space with activity stands attracting their attention. We develop a general modelling framework based on Langevin dynamics, which allows us to test the influence of two distinct types of ingredients on mobility: reactive or context-dependent factors, modelled by means of a force field generated by attraction points in a given spatial configuration and active or inherent factors, modelled from intrinsic movement patterns of the subjects. The additive and constructive framework model accounts for some observed features. Starting with the simplest model (purely random walkers) as a reference, we progressively introduce different ingredients such as persistence, memory and perceptual landscape, aiming to untangle active and reactive contributions and quantify their respective relevance. The proposed approach may help in anticipating the spatial distribution of citizens in alternative scenarios and in improving the design of public events based on a facts-based approach.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to contribute to the area of geodemographic research through the development of a new and novel flow-based classification of commuting for England and Wales. In doing so, it applies an approach to the analysis of commuting in which origin-destination flow-data, collected as part of the 2011 census of England and Wales, are segmented into groups based on shared similarities across multiple demographic and socioeconomic attributes. k-Means clustering was applied to 49 flow-based commuter variables for 513,892 interactions that captured 18.4 million of the 26.5 million workers recorded as part of the 2011 census of England and Wales. The final classification resulted in an upper-tier of nine {\textquoteleft}Supergroups{\textquoteright} which were subsequently partitioned to derive a lower-tier of 40 {\textquoteleft}Groups{\textquoteright}. A nomenclature was developed and associated pen portraits derived to provide basic signposting to the dominant characteristics of each cluster. Analysis of a selection of patterns underlying the ninefold Supergroup configuration revealed a highly variegated structure of commuting in England and Wales. The classification has potentially wide-ranging descriptive and analytical applications within research and policy domains and the approach would be equally transferable to other countries and contexts where origin-destination data are disaggregated based on commuter characteristics.},

Information about the movements of people is extracted from coarse-grained aggregated cellular network data without tracking mobile devices individually. Mobile phone data are provided by the Italian telecommunication company TIM and consist of density profiles (i.e. the spatial distribution) of people in a given area at various instants of time. By computing a suitable approximation of the Wasserstein distance between two consecutive density profiles, we are able to extract the main directions followed by people, i.e. to understand how the mass of people distribute in space and time. The main applications of the proposed technique are the monitoring of daily flows of commuters, the organization of large events, and, more in general, the traffic management and control.},

Coping with these issues in handling MBD requires understanding the challenges associated with it. Mobile computing and big data have been widely studied separately; however, very few studies have explored the convergence of these two domains. In this article, we critically review recent research efforts directed at MBD. We also classify the MBD by devising a thematic taxonomy that is based on source, analytics, applications, characteristics, security, and data type. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities offered by MBD in terms of analytics. Some potential uses of MBD in healthcare, telecommunication, digital advertising, and transportation are also presented. Several open research challenges are discussed as future research directions.},

	abstract = {Taxicabs are ubiquitous in cities throughout the world, and the industry is going through regulatory change with the growth of app-based services. In the United States, where taxicabs are typically regulated locally, licenses determine where taxis can pick up passengers. This means that for trips that end outside of licensed boundaries taxicabs are prohibited from picking up passengers and are forced to make {\textquotedblleft}deadhead{\textquotedblright} return trips. This research estimates empty taxi travel associated with spatial restrictions on passenger trip origins in New York City. In 2012, New York introduced a special taxi category intended to improve taxi access in areas of the city considered underserved by taxicabs. The new green taxicabs, as they are called, can drop off passengers anywhere in the city but are restricted from picking up passengers in the central business districts and at any of the region{\textquoteright}s airports. Using detailed trip data for each taxi ride, we estimate that up to 500,000 kilometers per week of deadhead travel are associated with restrictions on pick up locations, and more than 20 percent of all green taxicab trips end in an area where the driver is prohibited from picking up a new passenger.},

The mobility sector provides clear evidence of these dilemmas, as a wide range of users need to be engaged in the discourse over the innovations, and as existing governance structures may be unsuitable for addressing both the opportunities and limitations of innovation. This paper focuses on the sustainability implications of shared mobility and the need for new approaches to governance. A qualitative study of car sharing in London is used to examine the ideas, incentives, and institutions of the key actors involved in this sharing sector. The elements of change and continuity in the emerging sharing economy indicate the different possibilities for enhancing sustainable mobility. Any search for an alternative governance regime should take account of the ideational factors that would require an understanding of the different incentives needed to accommodate the full range of actors involved with the sharing economy.},

We examine this using Cragg two-part hurdle and ordinary least square (OLS) regression models employing data from the American Time Use Survey. We test whether: 1) large metropolitan area residents participate in more out-of-home activities because these activities are more plentiful, richer, and/or easier to access, 2) large metropolitan areas have lower travel times because of higher densities, and 3) activities in larger metropolitan areas have more positive associations with subjective well-being than those in smaller places. We reject all three hypotheses. Metropolitan area population size is largely unrelated to time spent outside the home, excluding travel. Large-metropolitan-area residents participate in more arts and entertainment activities and eat and drink out more often, but they socialize, volunteer, and care for others outside the home less. Larger metropolitan areas are associated with dramatically more travel time. We find no evidence that large metropolitan area activities contribute any more or less to life satisfaction or affect than activities in smaller places. We also find that life satisfaction does not covary with metropolitan area size. In sum, living in a large metropolitan area may primarily involve a tradeoff of (travel) time for money (higher wages), with little net change in welfare.},

To verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached, we implement a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results show that MC models can produce a prediction accuracy of 87\% for stationary trajectories and 95\% for non-stationary trajectories. Our findings indicate that human mobility is highly dependent on historical behaviors, and that the maximum predictability is not only a fundamental theoretical limit for potential predictive power, but also an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy.},

This article contributes a new empirical study to the debate of {\textquotedblleft}death of distance{\textquotedblright} by considering the effect of spatial autocorrelation in the estimation of distance decay effect with the incorporation of network autocorrelation in spatial econometric modeling. This work is based on a city-level dataset from China's largest social networking site called Weibo. The findings are shown as following. First, the coefficient value of network autocorrelation term (0.007, significant at 0.01 level) suggests that the city-level online social links are spatially dependent. In other words, these social connections are not randomly distributed across space but tend to form spatial clusters where neighboring links are more similar. Second, controlling spatial autocorrelation in the data, a distance decay effect on the formation of online social links is unveiled with a much smaller scaling exponent of the distances (i.e., 0.276) as compared to those (e.g., 2.0, 1.8, 1.45, 1.06, 1.03, 0.4, and 0.5) in existing studies. This research provides a useful modeling framework to analyze the real-world driving forces that characterize the patterns of social interactions in virtual space and thus advance our understanding in the connection of virtual and real spaces.},

Historically several of the human-related behaviours have been modelled with Poisson distribution, but a new dimension of understanding about the human behaviours is reached through all the gathered data in the emerging smart environment. This work analyses the data from the European Project SmartSantander. This work has correlated the traffic behaviour with respect to the temperature in the Santander City. This has been presented as the evolution of both flows present a similar behaviour. The traffic distribution, aggregated by temperature bins, follows up a Poisson distribution model. Thereby, allowing interpolate and predict complex behaviours based on simple measures such as the temperature. At the same time, this data presents a burst behaviour (human dynamics), when the data is analysed in sequence, instead of aggregated by temperature bins. Therefore, this work concludes that human-related behaviours can be described with both, Poisson and Human Dynamics distribution, depending on how the data is represented and aggregated.},

	abstract = {Sensors and systems within rapidly expanding smart cities produce citizen-centered big data which have potential value to support citizen-centered urban governance decision-making. There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.},

When expanding bike sharing business into a new city, most start-ups always wish to find out how to cover the whole city with a suitable bike distribution. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring bike distribution in new cities, which is challenging. As no dockless bikes are deployed in the new city, we propose to learn insights on bike distribution from cities populated with dockless bikes. We exploit multi-source data to identify important features that affect bike distributions and develop a novel inference model combining Factor Analysis and Convolutional Neural Network techniques. The extensive experiments on real-life datasets show that the proposed solution provides significantly more accurate inference results compared with competitive prediction methods.},

The IBM Watson Alchemy API (application program interface) was employed to quantify the sentiment scores conveyed by tweets on a large scale. Then we statistically analyzed the sentiment scores across different spaces and times. A multivariate linear mixed-effects model was used to quantify the fixed effects of land use and the time period on the variations in sentiment scores, considering the clustering effect of users. The results exposed clear spatiotemporal patterns of users{\textquoteright} sentiment. Higher sentiment scores were mainly observed in the commercial and public areas, during the noon/evening and on weekends. Our findings suggest that social media outputs can be used to better understand the spatial and temporal patterns of public happiness and well-being in cities and regions.},

On the basis of systematically collecting and collating historical documents related to natural disasters, and by adopting mathematical statistics, geological succession, correlation and other methods, analysis and comparison were made on the spatial-temporal differentiation of disasters and correlation between various major natural disasters taking place in the Chaohu Lake Basin during the Ming \&amp; Qing Dynasties (1368{\textendash}1912AD). The results show that 753 major disasters took place in the Chaohu Lake Basin during the Ming \&amp; Qing Dynasties. Among these, floods and droughts accounted for the largest percentage, while other disasters occurred occasionally. The Little Ice Age (1550{\textendash}1850AD) was the period with a high incidence of natural disasters, and in the years from 1701 to 1750 natural disasters took place most frequently; between 1651{\textendash}1700AD there was a declining period of flood frequency, though there were historically high occurrences of droughts and earthquakes. There were more floods than droughts suffered by Hefei, Shucheng, Chaohu, Wuwei and Hexian, while more droughts than floods suffered by Hanshan and Lujiang. Earthquakes in the basin mainly occurred in Chaohu, Shucheng, Hexian and Hefei, which are all near the Tan-Lu Fracture. The opposite is true for changes in the time scale of floods and droughts; this was probably caused by intra-seasonal oscillations of the subtropical high. The correlation between hails and wind disasters is significant, while other disasters are weakly correlated. There exists a certain association between spatial differentiation of occurrence frequency of natural disasters and landforms in the basin. The disaster-prone environment features landforms including plains, hills, low mountains, and these have a significant impact on the spatial distribution of five major natural disasters in the Chaohu Lake Basin.},

	abstract = {A large plethora of models to predict human mobility exists in the literature. The problem of how to select the most appropriate model to solve a specific mobility prediction task has however received only little attention. Yet a wrong model choice may lead to severe performance losses. In this paper, we address the model selection problem in human mobility prediction and make the following contributions. We present SELECTOR, a generic framework to explore human mobility data and compute both population models and individual models to predict human mobility. The former are models that are adapted to the characteristics of an entire population of users and can be used to overcome the cold-start problem. The latter are prediction models optimized for individual users. We present and analyze the results obtainable using SELECTOR on the Nokia data set, which is one of the largest and richest, publicly available data sets of human mobility data. We show that for many users generic population models can be used in place of individual models with negligible performance losses. Yet for about 25\% of the users individual models perform at least 3 percentage points better than population models. Thereby, we show that the use of phone context data does not lead to significantly better performance of human mobility predictors with respect to the case in which only temporal and spatial features are used. We further observe that the population models we derive are robust against the demographics of the users and that building different population models for different periods of the day leads to performance improvements. We make SELECTOR publicly available to allow other researchers and practitioners to explore further mobility data sets and to embed the code base of SELECTOR in their applications.},

	abstract = {For intelligent urban transportation systems, the ability to predict individual mobility is crucial for personalized traveler information, targeted demand management, and dynamic system operations. Whereas existing methods focus on predicting the next location of users, little is known regarding the prediction of the next trip. The paper develops a methodology for predicting daily individual mobility represented as a chain of trips (including the null set, no travel), each defined as a combination of the trip start time t, origin o, and destination d. To predict individual mobility, we first predict whether the user will travel (trip making prediction), and then, if so, predict the attributes of the next trip ( t , o , d ) (trip attribute prediction). Each of the two problems can be further decomposed into two subproblems based on the triggering event. For trip attribute prediction, we propose a new model, based on the Bayesian n-gram model used in language modeling, to estimate the probability distribution of the next trip conditional on the previous one. The proposed methodology is tested using the pseudonymized transit smart card records from more than 10,000 users in London, U.K. over two years. Based on regularized logistic regression, our trip making prediction models achieve median accuracy levels of over 80\%. The prediction accuracy for trip attributes varies by the attribute considered{\textemdash}around 40\% for t, 70{\textendash}80\% for o and 60{\textendash}70\% for d. Relatively, the first trip of the day is more difficult to predict. Significant variations are found across individuals in terms of the model performance, implying diverse travel behavior patterns.},

As described in this paper, we investigate the real-time interaction of events such as earthquakes in Twitter and propose an algorithm to monitor tweets and to detect a target event. To detect a target event, we devise a classifier of tweets based on features such as the keywords in a tweet, the number of words, and their context. Subsequently, we produce a probabilistic spatiotemporal model for the target event that can find the center and the trajectory of the event location. We consider each Twitter user as a sensor and apply Kalman filtering and particle filtering, which are widely used for location estimation in ubiquitous/pervasive computing. The particle filter works better than other comparable methods for estimating the centers of earthquakes and the trajectories of typhoons. As an application, we construct an earthquake reporting system in Japan. Because of the numerous earthquakes and the large number of Twitter users throughout the country, we can detect an earthquake with high probability (96\% of earthquakes of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) seismic intensity scale 3 or more are detected) merely by monitoring tweets. Our system detects earthquakes promptly and sends e-mails to registered users. Notification is delivered much faster than the announcements that are broadcast by the JMA.},

	abstract = {What is the purpose of a trip? What are the unique human mobility patterns and spatial contexts in or near the pickup points and delivery points of trajectories for a specific trip purpose? Many prior studies have modeled human mobility patterns in urban regions; however, these analytics mainly focus on interpreting the semantic meanings of geographic topics at an aggregate level. Given the lack of information about human activities at pick-up and dropoff points, it is challenging to convert the prior studies into effective tools for inferring trip purposes. To address this challenge, in this article, we study large-scale taxi trajectories from an unsupervised perspective in light of the following observations. First, the POI configurations of origin and destination regions closely relate to the urban functionality of these regions and further indicate various human activities. Second, with respect to the functionality of neighborhood environments, trip purposes can be discerned from the transitions between regions with different functionality at particular time periods. Along these lines, we develop a general probabilistic framework for spotting trip purposes from massive taxi GPS trajectories. Specifically, we first augment the origin and destination regions of trajectories by attaching neighborhood POIs. Then, we introduce a latent factor, POI Topic, to represent the mixed functionality of the regions, such that each origin or destination point in the city can be modeled as a mixture over POI Topics. In addition, considering the transitions from origins to destinations at specific time periods, the trip time is generated collaboratively from the pairwise POI Topics at both ends of the O-D pairs, constituting POI Links, and hence the trip purpose can be explained semantically by the POI Links. Finally, we present extensive experiments with the real-world data of New York City to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for spotting trip purposes, and moreover, the model is validated to perform well in predicting the destinations and trip time among all the baseline methods.},

The results show that: (1) a large proportion of the rural population migrated to urban areas in Hubei Province from 2009 to 2014, and the distribution of RUMs was uneven: developed areas attracted more RUMs than undeveloped regions; (2) the urban land in Hubei Province increased rapidly from 2009 to 2014, and the urban land use in Hubei Province was extensive and inefficient; (3) the decoupling types between RUMs and ULE in Hubei Province were dominated by expansive negative and weak decoupling; (4) according to the changes in per capita urban land area and decoupling types, the coordination relationship between RUMs and ULE in Hubei Province was divided into eight types, and while the relationship between RUMs and ULE in most areas were coordinated and beneficial to urban land intensive use, the rest were uncoordinated. Finally, reasonable implications for urban sustainable development and new land use policy were put forward.},

Outlining his argument for daily spatial mobility, author Aharon Kellerman focuses on needs and triggers for daily mobilities, on levels of personal mobility and personal autonomy in daily mobilities and on potential mobilities leading to practiced ones. The concept is further explored using three major types of daily mobility, terrestrial, virtual and aerial and three major spatial elements; urban spatial reorganization in the information age, mobility terminals, namely bus, metro, and railway stations as well as airports, and global opportunities through daily mobilities, notably for users of the Internet.},

	abstract = {Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are transforming a range of sectors from computer vision and natural language processing to autonomous driving and healthcare. In particular, deep learning methods achieve great success in many computer vision problems, such as image classification and object detection. Deep neural networks are very powerful to capture the hierarchical representation of features in massive and complex data by adopting multiple layers of non-linear information processing. Due to the availability of vast and high-resolution geospatial data and efficient high-performance computing architectures, deep learning techniques empower the geospatial system to provide fast and near-human level perception. For example, recent studies have shown deep learning techniques coupled with volunteered geographic information (such as OpenStreetMap data) can accurately extract buildings from satellite imagery for humanitarian mapping in rural African areas. Also, deep learning helps assimilate autonomous vehicles and intelligent transport system by incorporating a great amount of information gathered by traffic cameras and sensors. Moreover, deep learning technology facilitates the discovery of geographic information within unstructured text data across different languages. There are also many other applications of deep learning in the domain of GIS, such as the prediction for spatial diffusion patterns in epidemiology, urban expansion prediction, and hyperspectral image analysis. The 1st GeoAI workshop aims to bring geoscientists, computer scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and decision makers from academia, industry, and government to discuss the latest trends, successes, challenges, and opportunities in the field of deep learning for geographical data mining and knowledge discovery.},

As a result, city structure is largely shaped by this network, especially the streets that carry a higher volume of traffic. In practice, small areas along network edges often need to be grouped into regions for management purposes. This work formalizes the extension to the P-regions problem that takes the network as the underlying constraint and proposes a heuristic-based approach to solve the problem to near optimality. The network is subdivided into aggregator edges that attract regions and separator regions that divide areas apart. Two types of regions emerge in the region formation process: regions that grow along a certain network edge (network regions) and regions that grow from areas that are far away from all the network edges (planar regions). The heuristic solution effectively uses pre-computed spatial contiguity and distance matrices. The global objective function consists of the original heterogeneity factor and the discounted network proximity factor. This approach is elaborated with both a simulated and a real-world dataset. The regionalization results help design, study, and service regions that explicitly consider the network configuration with flexible parameter controls.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes consumer choices over lunchtime restaurants using data from a sample of several thousand anonymous mobile phone users in the San Francisco Bay Area. The data is used to identify users' approximate typical morning location, as well as their choices of lunchtime restaurants. We build a model where restaurants have latent characteristics (whose distribution may depend on restaurant observables, such as star ratings, food category, and price range), each user has preferences for these latent characteristics, and these preferences are heterogeneous across users. Similarly, each item has latent characteristics that describe users' willingness to travel to the restaurant, and each user has individual-specific preferences for those latent characteristics. Thus, both users' willingness to travel and their base utility for each restaurant vary across user-restaurant pairs. We use a Bayesian approach to estimation. To make the estimation computationally feasible, we rely on variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution, as well as stochastic gradient descent as a computational approach. Our model performs better than more standard competing models such as multinomial logit and nested logit models, in part due to the personalization of the estimates. We analyze how consumers re-allocate their demand after a restaurant closes to nearby restaurants versus more distant restaurants with similar characteristics, and we compare our predictions to actual outcomes. Finally, we show how the model can be used to analyze counterfactual questions such as what type of restaurant would attract the most consumers in a given location.},

	abstract = {In the 1980's, James Gleick's Chaos introduced the world to complexity. Now, Albert-L{\'a}szl{\'o} Barab{\'a}si's Linked reveals the next major scientific leap: the study of networks. We've long suspected that we live in a small world, where everything is connected to everything else. Indeed, networks are pervasive--from the human brain to the Internet to the economy to our group of friends. These linkages, it turns out, aren't random. All networks, to the great surprise of scientists, have an underlying order and follow simple laws. Understanding the structure and behavior of these networks will help us do some amazing things, from designing the optimal organization of a firm to stopping a disease outbreak before it spreads catastrophically.In Linked, Barab{\'a}si, a physicist whose work has revolutionized the study of networks, traces the development of this rapidly unfolding science and introduces us to the scientists carrying out this pioneering work. These "new cartographers" are mapping networks in a wide range of scientific disciplines, proving that social networks, corporations, and cells are more similar than they are different, and providing important new insights into the interconnected world around us. This knowledge, says Barab{\'a}si, can shed light on the robustness of the Internet, the spread of fads and viruses, even the future of democracy. Engaging and authoritative, Linked provides an exciting preview of the next century in science, guaranteed to be transformed by these amazing discoveries.From Linked:This book has a simple message: think networks. It is about how networks emerge, what they look like, and how they evolve. It aims to develop a web-based view of nature, society, and technology, providing a unified framework to better understand issues ranging from the vulnerability of the Internet to the spread of diseases. Networks are present everywhere. All we need is an eye for them...We will see the challenges doctors face when they attempt to cure a disease by focusing on a single molecule or gene, disregarding the complex interconnected nature of the living matter. We will see that hackers are not alone in attacking networks: we all play Goliath, firing shots at a fragile ecological network that, without further support, could soon replicate our worst nightmares by turning us into an isolated group of species...Linked is meant to be an eye-opening trip that challenges you to walk across disciplines by stepping out of the box of reductionism. It is an invitation to explore link by link the next scientific revolution: the new science of networks.},

Emergency response efforts depend upon the availability of timely information, such as information concerning the movements of affected populations. The analysis of aggregated and anonymized Call Detail Records (CDR) captured from the mobile phone infrastructure provides new possibilities to characterize human behavior during critical events. In this work, we investigate the viability of using CDR data combined with other sources of information to characterize the floods that occurred in Tabasco, Mexico in 2009. An impact map has been reconstructed using Landsat-7 images to identify the floods. Within this frame, the underlying communication activity signals in the CDR data have been analyzed and compared against rainfall levels extracted from data of the NASA-TRMM project. The variations in the number of active phones connected to each cell tower reveal abnormal activity patterns in the most affected locations during and after the floods that could be used as signatures of the floods - both in terms of infrastructure impact assessment and population information awareness. The representativeness of the analysis has been assessed using census data and civil protection records. While a more extensive validation is required, these early results suggest high potential in using cell tower activity information to improve early warning and emergency management mechanisms.},

	abstract = {According to personality psychology, personality traits determine many aspects of human behaviour. However, validating this insight in large groups has been challenging so far, due to the scarcity of multi-channel data. Here, we focus on the relationship between mobility and social behaviour by analysing two high-resolution longitudinal datasets collecting trajectories and mobile phone interactions of \${\textbackslash}sim 1000\$ individuals. We show that there is a connection between the way in which individuals explore new resources and exploit known assets in the social and spatial spheres. We point out that different individuals balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off in different ways and we explain part of the variability in the data by the big five personality traits. We find that, in both realms, extraversion correlates with an individual's attitude towards exploration and routine diversity, while neuroticism and openness account for the tendency to evolve routine over long time-scales. We find no evidence for the existence of classes of individuals across the spatio-social domains. Our results bridge the fields of human geography, sociology and personality psychology and can help improve current models of mobility and tie formation.},

	abstract = {The generation of realistic spatio-temporal trajectories of human mobility is of fundamental importance in a wide range of applications, such as the developing of protocols for mobile ad-hoc networks or what-if analysis in urban ecosystems. Current generative algorithms fail in accurately reproducing the individuals' recurrent schedules and at the same time in accounting for the possibility that individuals may break the routine during periods of variable duration. In this article we present DITRAS (DIary-based TRAjectory Simulator), a framework to simulate the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility. DITRAS operates in two steps: the generation of a mobility diary and the translation of the mobility diary into a mobility trajectory. We propose a data-driven algorithm which constructs a diary generator from real data, capturing the tendency of individuals to follow or break their routine. We also propose a trajectory generator based on the concept of preferential exploration and preferential return. We instantiate DITRAS with the proposed diary and trajectory generators and compare the resulting algorithm with real data and synthetic data produced by other generative algorithms, built by instantiating DITRAS with several combinations of diary and trajectory generators. We show that the proposed algorithm reproduces the statistical properties of real trajectories in the most accurate way, making a step forward the understanding of the origin of the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility.},

	abstract = {Human mobility is differentiated by time scales. While the mechanism for long time scales has been studied, the underlying mechanism on the daily scale is still unrevealed. Here, we uncover the mechanism responsible for the daily mobility patterns by analysing the temporal and spatial trajectories of thousands of persons as individual networks. Using the concept of motifs from network theory, we find only 17 unique networks are present in daily mobility and they follow simple rules. These networks, called here motifs, are sufficient to capture up to 90 per cent of the population in surveys and mobile phone datasets for different countries. Each individual exhibits a characteristic motif, which seems to be stable over several months. Consequently, daily human mobility can be reproduced by an analytically tractable framework for Markov chains by modelling periods of high-frequency trips followed by periods of lower activity as the key ingredient.},

	abstract = {The study of human mobility has gained much attention in recent years. To date, various models have been developed to predict human mobility patterns for intra- and/or inter-city cases. These models incorporate the populations as proxy variables in the place of real variables which cannot be observed easily. However, inaccuracies in predicting human mobility within cities are usually encountered. One source of inaccuracies in intra-city scenarios arises from the fact that cities{\textquoteright} populations are influenced by people from other areas. Therefore, population cannot be regarded as a good proxy variable for movement modeling. The objectives of this article are to introduce new proxy variables for use in current models for predicting human mobility patterns within cities, and to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions. In this study, we have introduced new proxy variables, namely, venues and check-ins, extracted from location-based social networks (LBSNs). In order to evaluate the models, we have compared our results with empirical data obtained from taxi vehicles, based on trip distances and destination population distributions. The S{\o}rensen similarity index (SSI) and R-squared measures were also used to compare the performances of models using each variable. The results show that all models with LBSN variables can capture real human movements better within Manhattan, New York City. Our analytical results indicated that the predicted trips using LBSN data are more similar to the real trips, on average, by about 20\% based on the SSI. Moreover, the R-squared measures obtained from regression analyses were enhanced significantly.},

Traditionally, various aspects of the household evacuation decisions have been determined by post-evacuation questionnaire surveys, which are usually time-consuming and expensive. Increased activity of users on social media, especially during emergencies, along with the geo-tagging of the posts, provides an opportunity to gain insights into user's decision-making process, as well as to gauge public opinion and activities using the social media data as a supplement to the traditional survey data. This paper leverages the geo-tagged Tweets posted in the New York City (NYC) in wake of Hurricane Sandy to understand the evacuation behavior of the residents. Based on the geo-tagged Tweet locations, we classify the NYC Twitter users into one of the three categories: outside evacuation zone, evacuees, and non-evacuees and examine the types of Tweets posted by each group during different phases of the hurricane. We establish a strong link between the social connectivity with the decision of the users to evacuate or stay. We analyze the geo-tagged Tweets to understand evacuation and return time and evacuation location patterns of evacuees. The analysis presented in this paper could be useful for authorities to plan a better evacuation campaign to minimize the risk to the life of the residents of the emergency hit areas.},

	abstract = {Background
People with schizophrenia and related psychotic illnesses have poor physical health and are at an increased risk of developing long-term physical health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. While this may be due to unhealthy lifestyles, such as lack of physical activity, circadian rhythm problems may also play a part. It is therefore important to be able to measure physical activity and sleep patterns in schizophrenia. This study aims to assess for feasibility by comparing ActiGraph accelerometer data, mobile phone app data and questionnaire data.

Methods
A cross-sectional comparison of different assessment methods of sleep and general activity was used. Assessment methods included:, a) ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers worn on the waist and wrist for 7 days., b) Lenovo A Plus smartphone apps {\textquoteleft}SleepBot{\textquoteright} and {\textquoteleft}Google Fit{\textquoteright} installed for the purposes of gathering data on sleep and physical activity patterns for 7 days., c) Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire taken at baseline and on day 7., At the seven-day assessment participants were interviewed using a topic guide covering their experiences. This explored the feasibility and acceptability of the measures and possible barriers for implementation.

Results
14 out of a planned 30 participants who met DSM IV-R criteria for schizophrenia spectrum psychoses have been recruited across Greater Manchester from wards and in the community. All participants were retained for the 7-day study duration. Preliminary assessment has shown concordance between the different measures. 3 out of the 14 participants engaged in vigorous physical activity during the 7 days. All 14 participants spent more than 50\% of their time sedentary during the 7 days. Participants showed fragmented sleep with a high number of awakenings.

Discussion
Using mobile phones and accelerometers are inexpensive and unobtrusive methods for measuring sleep and physical activity. These measures are feasible and acceptable to people with schizophrenia and are therefore suitable for implementation in routine clinical care. The measures can also be used by service users themselves to enhance their ability to monitor their own physical health. Such self-management and monitoring may encourage goal setting and improve autonomy, which have been found to be associated with increased levels of physical activity.},

One of the intriguing puzzles in social contagion under such conditions is the role of physical space. It is not understood either how geography influences the disappearance of products at the end of their life-cycle. In this paper, we utilize a unique dataset compiled from a Hungarian on-line social network (OSN) to uncover novel features in the spatial adoption and churn of digital technologies. The studied OSN was established in 2002 and failed in international competition about a decade later. We find that early adopter towns churn early; while individuals tend to follow the churn of nearby friends and are less influenced by the churn of distant contacts. An agent-based Bass Diffusion Model describes the process how the product gets adopted in the overall population. We show the limitations of the model regarding the spatial aspects of diffusion and identify the directions of model corrections. Assortativity of adoption time, urban scaling of adoption over the product life-cycle and a distance decay function of diffusion probability are the main factors that spatial diffusion models need to account for.},

Quantifying spatio-temporal patterns of urban expansion is essential to monitor and assess the process of urbanization and offer a theoretical basis for rural restructuring and landscape dynamics. In this paper, we used the remotely sensed land use data to quantify and research spatio-temporal patterns of urban expansion from 1985 to 2013 in Beijing, China. This study integrated methods of statistical analysis (i.e., calculation of time series landscape matrices and urban expansion index) and the gravity-center model to study the landscape configuration, the holistic change of urban land in area, size, expansion speed and movement direction, respectively. Meanwhile, GIS-based buffer analysis was also applied to study the spatial mode of urban expansion in Beijing. Results demonstrated that (1) Beijing has experienced magnificent urban sprawl in the last 28 years. The combination of time series landscape matrices exhibited a typical spatial configuration of urban sprawling in Beijing: leapfrog development of new urban nuclei formation in areas which were non-adjacent to existing urban centers with obvious fragmentation, as well as expansion of existing urban areas resulting in contiguous urban entities in each time interval; (2) The gravity center of urban land continued moving northeastward, except during the time intervals of 1995{\textendash}2000 and 2010{\textendash}2013 when it moved southward; (3) The northern fan-shaped suburb was the most active area of urban expansion before 2005, and urban later had a concentrated expansion toward the southern inverted-triangle-shaped area; and (4) Urban sprawl presented denotative features along the motorways, while urban also expanded in the form of a big pancake.},

These fractal dimensions can numerically describe the complexity of passenger flow in the urban rail transit network and its change characteristics. Based on it, we establish a fractal quantification method to measure the fractal characteristics of passenger follow in the rail transit network. Finally, we validate the reasonability of our proposed method by using the actual data of Beijing subway network. It has been shown that our proposed method can effectively measure the scale-free range of the urban rail transit network, network development and the fractal characteristics of time-varying passenger flow, which further provides a reference for network planning and analysis of passenger flow.},

	abstract = {The interaction between disease and disease information on complex networks has facilitated an interdisciplinary research area. When a disease begins to spread in the population, the corresponding information would also be transmitted among individuals, which in turn influence the spreading pattern of the disease. In this paper, firstly, we analyze the propagation of two representative diseases (H7N9 and Dengue fever) in the real-world population and their corresponding information on Internet, suggesting the high correlation of the two-type dynamical processes. Secondly, inspired by empirical analyses, we propose a nonlinear model to further interpret the coupling effect based on the SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) model. Both simulation results and theoretical analysis show that a high prevalence of epidemic will lead to a slow information decay, consequently resulting in a high infected level, which shall in turn prevent the epidemic spreading. Finally, further theoretical analysis demonstrates that a multi-outbreak phenomenon emerges via the effect of coupling dynamics, which finds good agreement with empirical results. This work may shed light on the in-depth understanding of the interplay between the dynamics of epidemic spreading and information diffusion.},

Recent advances on network theory have improved our understanding of the epidemic processes at large scale. However, there are several considerations that have still to be evaluated as relevant or not in the study of epidemic spreading. One of these considerations is that of accounting for the influence of origin and destination patterns in the flow of the carriers of an epidemic. Here we compute origin-destination patterns compatible with empirical data of coarse grained flows in the air transportation network. We study the incidence of epidemic processes in a metapopulation approach considering different alternatives to the flows prior knowledge. The data-driven scenario where the estimation of origin and destination flows is considered is relevant to assess the impact of the epidemics at a microscopic level (in our scenario, which populations are infected) while turns out to be irrelevant when considering macroscopic incidence (fraction of infected populations). These results are of interest to implement even better computational platforms to forecast epidemic incidence.},

	abstract = {Social media analytics is a research axis focused on extracting useful insights from social media data, with the aim of helping individuals and organizations take the most optimum decisions regarding several disciplines of life (business, marketing, politics, health, etc.). In this respect, social networks, microblogging, and media-sharing websites represent striking instances of online social media, as constructed under the Web 2.0 associated technologies, targeted to promote the interaction between users and these websites, while shifting the user{\textquoteright}s position from that of a mere consumer to that of a social data producer. Hence, huge amounts of social data turn out to be issued, thus turning into critical sources of Big Data. Actually, the traditional media analytical techniques seem obsolete and inadequate to process this huge array of unstructured social media and capture the massive data range, mainly the shifting from the batch scale to the streaming one. Such a process has culminated in injecting Big Data technologies throughout the analysis process. So, the present survey is targeted to help the concerned researchers identify the challenges encountered during the analysis process along with Big Data solutions. Indeed, the aim lies in providing a clear analytical process applicable with Big Data technologies. A systematic literature review is conducted to address the challenges facing integration of Big Data technologies, while displaying some adequate solutions. Following extensive literature search, an overall global view concerning the superposition of the social media analytics and Big Data technologies has been drawn and discussed, along with a promising potential research trend.},

One fundamental question for this research area is how to measure individual activity space, which is an indicator of where and how people have contact with their social and physical environments. Conventionally, standard deviational ellipses, road network buffers, minimum convex polygons, and kernel density surfaces have been used to represent people{\textquoteright}s activity space, but they all have shortcomings. Inconsistent findings of the effects of environmental exposures on health behaviors/outcomes suggest that the reliability of existing studies may be affected by the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). This paper proposes the context-based crystal-growth activity space as an innovative method for generating individual activity space based on both GPS trajectories and the environmental context. This method not only considers people{\textquoteright}s actual daily activity patterns based on GPS tracks but also takes into account the environmental context which either constrains or encourages people{\textquoteright}s daily activity. Using GPS trajectory data collected in Chicago, the results indicate that the proposed new method generates more reasonable activity space when compared to other existing methods. This can help mitigate the UGCoP in environmental health studies.},

In recent years cell phone data has received a lot of attention as a promising data source because of the wide coverage, long observation period, and low cost. The challenge in utilizing such data is how to robustly extract people{\textquoteright}s trip sequences from sparse and noisy cell phone data and endow the extracted trips with semantic meaning, i.e., trip purposes. In this study we reconstruct trip sequences from sparse cell phone records. Next we propose a Bayesian trip purpose classification method and compare it to a Markov random field based trip purpose clustering method, representing scenarios with and without labeled training data respectively. This procedure shows how the cell phone data, despite their coarse granularity and sparsity, can be turned into a low cost, long term, and ubiquitous sensor network for mobility related services.},

	abstract = {Novel digital data sources allow us to attain enhanced knowledge about locations and mobilities of people in space and time. Already a fast-growing body of literature demonstrates the applicability and feasibility of mobile phone-based data in social sciences for considering mobile devices as proxies for people. However, the implementation of such data imposes many theoretical and methodological challenges. One major issue is the uneven spatial resolution of mobile phone data due to the spatial configuration of mobile network base stations and its spatial interpolation. To date, different interpolation techniques are applied to transform mobile phone data into other spatial divisions. However, these do not consider the temporality and societal context that shapes the human presence and mobility in space and time. The paper aims, first, to contribute to mobile phonebased research by addressing the need to give more attention to the spatial interpolation of given data, and further by proposing a dasymetric interpolation approach to enhance the spatial accuracy of mobile phone data. Second, it contributes to population modelling research by combining spatial, temporal and volumetric dasymetric mapping and integrating it with mobile phone data. In doing so, the paper presents a generic conceptual framework of a multi-temporal function-based dasymetric (MFD) interpolation method for mobile phone data. Empirical results demonstrate how the proposed interpolation method can improve the spatial accuracy of both night-time and daytime population distributions derived from different mobile phone data sets by taking advantage of ancillary data sources. The proposed interpolation method can be applied for both location- and person-based research, and is a fruitful starting point for improving the spatial interpolation methods for mobile phone data. We share the implementation of our method in GitHub as open access Python code.},

People{\textquoteright}s movement behaviors are strongly affected by their social interactions with each other, which, however, are not sufficiently considered in most existing mobility models. Recent studies in social network theory have provided many theoretical and experimental results, which are useful and powerful for modeling the realistic social dimension of human mobility. In this article we present a novel human mobility model based on heterogeneous centrality and overlapping community structure in social networks. Instead of extracting communities from artificially generated social graphs, our model manages to construct the k-clique overlapping community structure which satisfies the common statistical features observed from distinct real social networks. This approach achieves a good trade-off between complexity and reality. The simulation results of our model exhibit characteristics observed from real human motion traces, especially heterogeneous human mobility popularity, which has significant impact on data forwarding schemes but has never been considered by existing mobility models.},

This paper does not deal with the latter issue with respect to why, and instead investigates whether Zipf{\textquoteright}s law holds in a global setting, thus involving all cities around the world. Unlike previous studies, which have mainly relied on conventional census data such as populations, and census-bureau-imposed definitions of cities, we adopt naturally (in terms of data speaks for itself) delineated cities, or natural cities, to be more precise, in order to examine Zipf{\textquoteright}s law. We find that Zipf{\textquoteright}s law holds remarkably well for all natural cities at the global level, and remains almost valid at the continental level except for Africa at certain time instants. We further examine the law at the country level, and note that Zipf{\textquoteright}s law is violated from country to country or from time to time. This violation is mainly due to our limitations; we are limited to individual countries, or to a static view on city-size distributions. The central argument of this paper is that Zipf{\textquoteright}s law is universal, and we therefore must use the correct scope in order to observe it. We further find Zipf{\textquoteright}s law applied to city numbers; the number of cities in the first largest country is twice as many as that in the second largest country, three times as many as that in the third largest country, and so on. These findings have profound implications for big data and the science of cities.},

	abstract = {The technologies of mobile communications pervade our society and wireless networks sense the movement of people, generating large volumes of mobility data, such as mobile phone call records and Global Positioning System (GPS) tracks. In this work, we illustrate the striking analytical power of massive collections of trajectory data in unveiling the complexity of human mobility. We present the results of a large-scale experiment, based on the detailed trajectories of tens of thousands private cars with on-board GPS receivers, tracked during weeks of ordinary mobile activity. We illustrate the knowledge discovery process that, based on these data, addresses some fundamental questions of mobility analysts: what are the frequent patterns of people{\textquoteright}s travels? How big attractors and extraordinary events influence mobility? How to predict areas of dense traffic in the near future? How to characterize traffic jams and congestions? We also describe M-Atlas, the querying and mining language and system that makes this analytical process possible, providing the mechanisms to master the complexity of transforming raw GPS tracks into mobility knowledge. M-Atlas is centered onto the concept of a trajectory, and the mobility knowledge discovery process can be specified by M-Atlas queries that realize data transformations, data-driven estimation of the parameters of the mining methods, the quality assessment of the obtained results, the quantitative and visual exploration of the discovered behavioral patterns and models, the composition of mined patterns, models and data with further analyses and mining, and the incremental mining strategies to address scalability.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of how individual mobility patterns shape and impact the social network is limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of network dynamics and evolution. This question is largely unexplored, partly due to the difficulty in obtaining large-scale society-wide data that simultaneously capture the dynamical information on individual movements and social interactions. Here we address this challenge for the first time by tracking the trajectories and communication records of 6 Million mobile phone users. We find that the similarity between two individuals' movements strongly correlates with their proximity in the social network. We further investigate how the predictive power hidden in such correlations can be exploited to address a challenging problem: which new links will develop in a social network. We show that mobility measures alone yield surprising predictive power, comparable to traditional network-based measures. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy can be significantly improved by learning a supervised classifier based on combined mobility and network measures. We believe our findings on the interplay of mobility patterns and social ties offer new perspectives on not only link prediction but also network dynamics.},

This paper proposes and evaluates WHERE, a novel approach to modeling how large populations move within different metropolitan areas. WHERE takes as input spatial and temporal probability distributions drawn from empirical data, such as Call Detail Records (CDRs) from a cellular telephone network, and produces synthetic CDRs for a synthetic population. We have validated WHERE against billions of anonymous location samples for hundreds of thousands of phones in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. We found that WHERE offers significantly higher fidelity than other modeling approaches. For example, daily range of travel statistics fall within one mile of their true values, an improvement of more than 14 times over a Weighted Random Waypoint model. Our modeling techniques and synthetic CDRs can be applied to a wide range of problems while avoiding many of the privacy concerns surrounding real CDRs.},

Moreover, the method does not work well when extended to power-law distributions with an upper truncation. We explain in detail a similar but alternative procedure, valid for truncated as well as for non-truncated power-law distributions, based in maximum likelihood estimation, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test, and Monte Carlo simulations. An overview of the main concepts as well as a recipe for their practical implementation is provided. The performance of our method is put to test on several empirical data which were previously analyzed with less systematic approaches. We find the functioning of the method very satisfactory.},

More specifically, exploring the patterns of human mobility based on large amounts of multi-source data plays an important role in analyzing the formation of social-economic phenomena in smart cities. However, our acquired knowledge is still very limited for smart cities. In this article, we propose an integrated computing method to rescale heterogeneous traffic trajectory data, which leverages Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our analysis is based on two real datasets generated by subway smart card transactions and taxi GPS trajectories from Shanghai in China, which contain more than 451 million trading records by 14 subway lines and 34 billion GPS records by 13,695 taxis respectively. Especially, we quantitatively explore the patterns of human mobility on weekends and weekdays respectively. Through logarithmic binning and data fitness, we calculate the Bayesian weights to select the best fitting distributions. In addition, we leverage three metrics to analyze the patterns of human mobility in two datasets i.e., trip displacement, trip duration, and trip interval. We obtain several important human mobility patterns and discover quite a few interesting phenomena, which lay a solid foundation for future research.},

(doi:10.1016/S1755-5345(13)70005-8)) and drive the development of transportation systems. Current route-choice models that are used in transportation planning are based on the widely accepted assumption that people follow the minimum cost path (Wardrop 1952 Proc. Inst. Civ. Eng. 1, 325{\textendash}362. (doi:10.1680/ipeds.1952.11362)), despite little empirical support. Fine-grained location traces collected by smart devices give us today an unprecedented opportunity to learn how citizens organize their travel plans into a set of routes, and how similar behaviour patterns emerge among distinct individual choices. Here we study 92 419 anonymized GPS trajectories describing the movement of personal cars over an 18-month period. We group user trips by origin{\textendash}destination and we find that most drivers use a small number of routes for their routine journeys, and tend to have a preferred route for frequent trips. In contrast to the cost minimization assumption, we also find that a significant fraction of drivers' routes are not optimal. We present a spatial probability distribution that bounds the route selection space within an ellipse, having the origin and the destination as focal points, characterized by high eccentricity independent of the scale. While individual routing choices are not captured by path optimization, their spatial bounds are similar, even for trips performed by distinct individuals and at various scales. These basic discoveries can inform realistic route-choice models that are not based on optimization, having an impact on several applications, such as infrastructure planning, routing recommendation systems and new mobility solutions.},

More recently, these data have come tagged with geographical information, enabling studies of human mobility patterns and the science of cities. We combine these two pursuits and uncover reproducible mobility patterns among social contacts. First, we introduce measures of mobility similarity and predictability and measure them for populations of users in three large urban areas. We find individuals' visitations patterns are far more similar to and predictable by social contacts than strangers and that these measures are positively correlated with tie strength. Unsupervised clustering of hourly variations in mobility similarity identifies three categories of social ties and suggests geography is an important feature to contextualize social relationships. We find that the composition of a user's ego network in terms of the type of contacts they keep is correlated with mobility behaviour. Finally, we extend a popular mobility model to include movement choices based on social contacts and compare its ability to reproduce empirical measurements with two additional models of mobility.},

	abstract = {Ever since first mobile phones equipped with Global Position System (GPS) came to the market, knowing the exact user location has become a holy grail of almost every service that lives in the digital world. Starting with the idea of location based services, nowadays it is not only important to know where users are in real time, but also to be able predict where they will be in future. Moreover, it is not enough to know user location in form of latitude longitude coordinates provided by GPS devices, but also to give a place its meaning (i.e., semantically label it), in particular detecting the most probable home location for the given user. The aim of this paper is to provide novel insights on differences among the ways how different types of human digital trails represent the actual mobility patterns and therefore the differences between the approaches interpreting those trails for inferring said patterns. Namely, with the emergence of different digital sources that provide information about user mobility, it is of vital importance to fully understand that not all of them capture exactly the same picture. With that being said, in this paper we start from an example showing how human mobility patterns described by means of radius of gyration are different for Flickr social network and dataset of bank card transactions. Rather than capturing human movements closer to their homes, Flickr more often reveals people travel mode. Consequently, home location inferring methods used in both cases cannot be the same. We consider several methods for home location definition known from the literature and demonstrate that although for bank card transactions they provide highly consistent results, home location definition detection methods applied to Flickr dataset happen to be way more sensitive to the method selected, stressing the paramount importance of adjusting the method to the specific dataset being used.},

By extracting and modeling the mobile cellular data associated with over 9600 cellular towers deployed in a metropolitan city of China, this article aims to link cyberspace and the physical world with social ecology via such big data. We first extract a human mobility and cellular traffic consumption trace from the dataset, and then investigate human behavior in cyberspace and the physical world. Our analysis reveals that human mobility and the consumed mobile traffic have strong correlations, and both have distinct periodical patterns in the time domain. In addition, both human mobility and mobile traffic consumption are linked with social ecology, which in turn helps us to better understand human behavior. We believe that the proposed big data processing and modeling methodology, combined with the empirical analysis on mobile traffic, human mobility, and social ecology, paves the way toward a deep understanding of human behaviors in a large-scale metropolis.},

In particular, big events influence human mobility depending on the dynamics of the events. However, this influence has not been explored to understand big events. In this paper, we propose a methodology for learning about big events from human mobility pattern. The methodology involves extracting and analysing the stopping, approaching, and moving-away interactions between public transportation vehicles and the geographic context. The analysis is carried out at two different temporal granularity levels to discover global and local patterns. The results of evaluating this methodology on bus trajectories demonstrate that it can discover occurrences of big events from mobility patterns, roughly estimate the event start and end time, and reveal the temporal patterns of arrival and departure of event attendees. This knowledge can be usefully applied in transportation and event planning and management.},

We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting that similar image data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities.

	abstract = {Nowadays, human movement in urban spaces can be traced digitally in many cases. It can be observed that movement patterns are not constant, but vary across time and space. In this work, we characterize such spatio-temporal patterns with an innovative combination of two separate approaches that have been utilized for studying human mobility in the past. First, by using non-negative tensor factorization (NTF), we are able to cluster human behavior based on spatio-temporal dimensions. Second, for characterizing these clusters, we propose to use HypTrails, a Bayesian approach for expressing and comparing hypotheses about human trails. To formalize hypotheses, we utilize publicly available Web data (i.e., Foursquare and census data). By studying taxi data in Manhattan, we can discover and characterize human mobility patterns that cannot be identified in a collective analysis. As one example, we find a group of taxi rides that end at locations with a high number of party venues on weekend nights. Our findings argue for a more fine-grained analysis of human mobility in order to make informed decisions for e.g., enhancing urban structures, tailored traffic control and location-based recommender systems.},

I use micro-data that includes the exact address of all the foreign and native population in Barcelona, combined with geometric indicators for urban shape at the block level. Using these data, I construct measures of segregation over time to evaluate the degree to which individuals from different origins, share building space with other immigrants or with the native-born Spaniards. Differences in the built environment appear to have a sizable effect on how immigrants coexist with host communities. The arrival of immigrants to suburban areas is associated with less segregation than other areas. In particular, certain spatial qualities such as open space centrality, coverage and compactness are beneficial in mediating the effect of immigrants on segregation. My results reinforce the idea that a process of suburbanization might have decreased segregation between immigrants and natives, possibly due to native communities being less sensitive to coexisting with immigrant populations in less dense areas.},

	abstract = {Urban air pollution imposes major environmental and health risks worldwide, and is expected to become worse in the coming decades as cities expand. Detailed monitoring of urban air quality at high spatial and temporal resolution can help to assess the negative impacts as a first step towards mitigation. Improvement of air quality needs a variety of measures working together, including controlling industrial pollution and mitigating automobile emissions. In contrast to the measurable industrial pollution, in many of the developing countries, the impact and control of automobile emissions on air quality is neither well understood nor well established. Moreover, the automobile emission data sets are difficult to collect. In this paper, we present a data analysis framework to uncover the impact of urban traffic on estimating air quality in different locations within a metropolitan area. To that end, we estimate the traffic surrounding 24 air quality (AQ) monitoring stations in Beijing, combining mobile phone data and road networks with a traffic assignment model. We investigate how the amount of traffic surrounding each station can impact the modeling of air quality index (AQI) observed by the stations. We separately estimate the contribution of traffic information to the modeling of AQI with regression models in the summer and winter. Further, we group the AQ monitoring stations into four classes, and show that in the summer, air pollution in the inner city is generally more severe than that in the suburbs due to urban traffic; while in the winter, air pollution in the south of Beijing surpasses that in the inner city, most likely due to heating using coal.},

	abstract = {Recently, smart-phone based technology has enabled ridesharing services to match customers making similar trips in realtime for a reduced rate and minimal inconvenience. But what are the impacts of such services on city-wide congestion? The answer lies in whether or not ridesharing adds to vehicle traffic by diverting non-driving trips like walking, transit, or cycling, or reduces vehicle traffic by diverting trips otherwise made in private, single occupancy cars or taxis. This research explores the impact of rideshare adoption on congestion using mobile phone data. We extract average daily origin-destination (OD) trips from mobile phone records and estimate the proportions of these trips made by auto and other non-auto travelers. Next, we match spatially and temporally similar trips, and assume a range of adoption rates for auto and non-auto users, in order to distill rideshare vehicle trips. Finally, for several adoption scenarios, we evaluate the impacts of congestion network-wide.},

	abstract = {As network research becomes more sophisticated, it is more common than ever for researchers to find themselves not studying a single network but needing to analyze sets of networks. An important task when working with sets of networks is network comparison, developing a similarity or distance measure between networks so that meaningful comparisons can be drawn. The best means to accomplish this task remains an open area of research. Here we introduce a new measure to compare networks, the Portrait Divergence, that is mathematically principled, incorporates the topological characteristics of networks at all structural scales, and is general-purpose and applicable to all types of networks. An important feature of our measure that enables many of its useful properties is that it is based on a graph invariant, the network portrait. We test our measure on both synthetic graphs and real world networks taken from protein interaction data, neuroscience, and computational social science applications. The Portrait Divergence reveals important characteristics of multilayer and temporal networks extracted from data.},

The problem is essentially related to almost all scientific disciplines and thus has attracted attention of scholars from different backgrounds. Progress on SOS will lead to better solutions for many challenging issues, ranging from the selection of candidate faculty members by a university to the development of research fields to which a country should give priority. While different measurements have been designed to evaluate the scientific impact of scholars, journals and academic institutions, the multiplex structure, dynamics and evolution mechanisms of the whole system have been much less studied until recently. In this article, we review the recent advances in SOS, aiming to cover the topics from empirical study, network analysis, mechanistic models, ranking, prediction, and many important related issues. The results summarized in this review significantly deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and statistical rules governing the science system. Finally, we review the forefront of SOS research and point out the specific difficulties as they arise from different contexts, so as to stimulate further efforts in this emerging interdisciplinary field.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel analogy between the movements in the cyber space and the physical space. This analogy implies a new way of studying human online activities by modelling the activities across online communities in a similar fashion as the movements among locations. First, we quantitatively validate the analogy by comparing several important properties of human online activities and physical movements. Our experiments reveal striking similarities between the cyber space and the physical space. Next, inspired by the established methodology on human mobility in the physical space, we propose a framework to study human "mobility" across online platforms. We discover three interesting patterns of user engagements in online communities. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that people with different mobility patterns also exhibit divergent preferences to online communities. This work not only attempts to achieve a better understanding of human online activities, but also intends to open a promising research direction with rich implications and applications.},

On average, CRH accessibility positively affects regional tourism economies, reflected in a 12\% net increase in tourism revenue for a region. By dividing the database into different subsets, this study demonstrates that the significantly positive impacts only occur for regions where the overall level of accessibility is low. Moreover, this study reveals that among regions connected by CRH networks, the regions of which the levels of tourism development are comparatively low will experience a bigger jump in tourism economy than the regions of which the levels of tourism development are already high, and hence the dispersion effect of CRH networks is demonstrated. This study also concludes the lagged effects of CRH accessibility are much greater than its immediate effects. By virtue of these conclusions, this study suggests the ways for governments and tourism organizations to take advantage of the development of high-speed trains in China.},

Modeling the structure and dynamics of segregation is a pressing problem for sociology and urban planning, but existing methods have limitations. In this paper, we develop a suite of methods, grounded in information theory, for studying the spatial structure of segregation. We first advance existing profile and decomposition methods by posing two related regionalization methods, which allow for profile curves with nonconstant spatial scale and decomposition analysis with nonarbitrary areal units. We then formulate a measure of local spatial scale, which may be used for both detailed, within-city analysis and intercity comparisons. These methods highlight detailed insights in the structure and dynamics of urban segregation that would be otherwise easy to miss or difficult to quantify. They are computationally efficient, applicable to a broad range of study questions, and freely available in open source software.},

Employing a panel data program evaluation method devised by Hsiao, Ching, and Wan (2012), we construct hypothetical counterfactuals for per capita real GDP of HSR cities in the absence of their respective HSR projects using the outcomes in selected non-HSR cities. We find that the responses to HSR treatment are heterogeneous with regard to location, route, and region. The location-level impact ranges between 5\% and 59\% and is not temporary. HSR cities with positive effects concentrate along the Hu-Ning Segment, the Yong-Tai-Wen-Fu-Xia Segment, and within the Hunan province along the Wu-Guang HSR. These cities are mainly located in the eastern coastal regions of China, in core urban agglomeration regions that allow them to be transportation hubs. In general, the gain for local economies is greater for cities that are more industrialized, with more ability of the service sector to absorb enough labor, and with better supporting infrastructure. On the other hand, local protectionism hampers the development of HSR cities. We also show that at different project stages, HSR cities experience different gains.},

However, many previous PM2.5 exposure assessments have practical limitations, due to the assumption that population distribution or air pollution levels are spatially stationary and temporally constant and people move within regions of generally the same air quality throughout a day or other time periods. To deal with this challenge, we propose a novel method to achieve the real-time estimation of population exposure to PM2.5 in China by integrating mobile-phone locating-request (MPL) big data and station-based PM2.5 observations. Nationwide experiments show that the proposed method can yield the estimation of population exposure to PM2.5 concentrations and cumulative inhaled PM2.5 masses with a 3-h updating frequency. Compared with the census-based method, it introduced the dynamics of population distribution into the exposure estimation, thereby providing an improved way to better assess the population exposure to PM2.5 at different temporal scales. Additionally, the proposed method and dataset can be easily extended to estimate other ambient pollutant exposures such as PM10, O3, SO2, and NO2, and may hold potential utilities in supporting the environmental exposure assessment and related policy-driven environmental actions.},

Yet, few studies are capable of quantifying well how different groups of people in different places experience different levels of air pollution at the global scale. In this paper, we use worldwide Chinese as a lens to quantify the spatiotemporal variations and geographic differences in PM2.5 exposures using unprecedented mobile phone big data and air pollution records. The results show that Chinese in South and East Asia suffer relatively serious PM2.5 exposures, where the Chinese in China have the highest PM2.5 exposures (52.8  $\mu$ g/m3/year), which is fourfold higher than the exposures in the United States (10.7  $\mu$ g/m3/year). Overall, the Chinese in Asian cities (35.5  $\mu$ g/m3/year) experienced the most serious PM2.5 exposures when compared with the Chinese in the cities of other continents. These results, partly presented as a spatiotemporally explicit map of PM2.5 exposures for worldwide Chinese, help researchers and governments to consider how to address the effects of air pollution on public health with respect to different population groups and geographic locations.},

	abstract = {Complex systems are characterized by many interacting units that give rise to emergent behavior. A particularly advantageous way to study these systems is through the analysis of the networks that encode the interactions among the system's constituents. During the last two decades, network science has provided many insights in natural, social, biological and technological systems. However, real systems are more often than not interconnected, with many interdependencies that are not properly captured by single layer networks. To account for this source of complexity, a more general framework, in which different networks evolve or interact with each other, is needed. These are known as multilayer networks. Here we provide an overview of the basic methodology used to describe multilayer systems as well as of some representative dynamical processes that take place on top of them. We round off the review with a summary of several applications in diverse fields of science.},

The four categories are uniquely associated with mutually exclusive generative mechanisms: self-organized criticality, proportionate differentiation, incremental differentiation, and homogenization. We then introduce distribution pitting, a falsification-based method for comparing distributions to assess how well each one fits a given data set. In doing so, we also introduce decision rules to determine the likely dominant shape and generative mechanism among many that may operate concurrently. Next, we implement distribution pitting using 229 samples of individual output for several occupations (e.g., movie directors, writers, musicians, athletes, bank tellers, call center employees, grocery checkers, electrical fixture assemblers, and wirers). Results suggest that for 75\% of our samples, exponential tail distributions and their generative mechanism (i.e., incremental differentiation) likely constitute the dominant distribution shape and explanation of nonnormally distributed individual output. This finding challenges past conclusions indicating the pervasiveness of other types of distributions and their generative mechanisms. Our results further contribute to theory by offering premises about the link between past and future individual output. For future research, our taxonomy and methodology can be used to pit distributions of other variables (e.g., organizational citizenship behaviors). Finally, we offer practical insights on how to increase overall individual output and produce more top performers. (PsycINFO Database Record},

In the case of online book sales, the proportion of tail sales has been estimated using regression techniques on the assumption that the data obeys a power-law distribution. Here we propose a different technique for estimation based on a generative model of book sales that results in an asymptotic power-law distribution of sales, but which does not suffer from the problems related to power-law regression techniques. We show that the proportion of tail sales predicted is very sensitive to the estimated power-law exponent. In particular, if we assume that the power-law exponent of the cumulative distribution is closer to 1.1 rather than to 1.2 (estimates published in 2003, calculated using regression by two groups of researchers), then our computations suggest that the tail sales of Amazon.com, rather than being 40\% as estimated by Brynjolfsson, Hu and Smith in 2003, are actually closer to 20\%, the proportion estimated by its CEO.},

In particular, numerous recent studies have lead to an unexpected consensus: the considerable variability in the characteristic travelled distance of individuals coexists with a high degree of predictability of their future locations. Here we shed light on this surprising coexistence by systematically investigating the impact of recurrent mobility on the characteristic distance travelled by individuals. Using both mobile phone and GPS data, we discover the existence of two distinct classes of individuals: returners and explorers. As existing models of human mobility cannot explain the existence of these two classes, we develop more realistic models able to capture the empirical findings. Finally, we show that returners and explorers play a distinct quantifiable role in spreading phenomena and that a correlation exists between their mobility patterns and social interactions.},

We compare the travel behaviour of each segment in terms of the preference for types of trip destinations. The point of interest (POI) data are used to cluster grid cells of a city according to the main function of a grid cell, serving as a reference to determine the type of trip destination. The method is tested for the city of Shanghai, China, by using a special mobile phone dataset that includes not only the spatial-temporal traces but also the mobile internet usage behaviour of the same users. We identify statistically significant relationships between a traveller{\textquoteright}s favourite category of mobile internet content and more frequent types of trip destinations that he/she visits. For example, compared to others, people whose favourite type of app/website is in the {\textquotedblleft}tourism{\textquotedblright} category significantly preferred to visit touristy areas. Moreover, users with different levels of internet usage intensity show different preferences for types of destinations as well. We found that people who used mobile internet more intensively were more likely to visit more commercial areas, and people who used it less preferred to have activities in predominantly residential areas.},

We show that individual mobility is dominated by small groups of frequently visited, dynamically close locations, forming primary {\textquotedblleft}habitats{\textquotedblright} capturing typical daily activity, along with subsidiary habitats representing additional travel. These habitats do not correspond to typical contexts such as home or work. The temporal evolution of mobility within habitats, which constitutes most motion, is universal across habitats and exhibits scaling patterns both distinct from all previous observations and unpredicted by current models. The delay to enter subsidiary habitats is a primary factor in the spatiotemporal growth of human travel. Interestingly, habitats correlate with non-mobility dynamics such as communication activity, implying that habitats may influence processes such as information spreading and revealing new connections between human mobility and social networks.},

	abstract = {Urban anomalies, such as abnormal movements of crowds and accidents, may result in loss of life or property if not handled properly. It would be of great value for governments if anomalies can be automatically alerted in their early stage. However, detecting anomalies in urban area has two main challenges. First, the criteria to determine an anomaly on different occasions (e.g. rainy days vs. sunny days, or holidays vs. workdays) and in different places (e.g. tourist attractions vs. office areas) are distinctly different, as these occasions and places have their own definitions on normal patterns. Second, urban anomalies often exhibit complex forms (e.g. road closure may cause decrease in taxi flow and increase in bike flow). We need an algorithm that not only models the anomaly degree of individual data source but also the combination of changes in multiple data sources. In this paper, we propose a two-step method to tackle those challenges. In the first step, we use a similarity-based algorithm to estimate an anomaly score for each individual data source in each region and time slot based on the values of historically similar regions. Those scores are fed into the second step, where we propose an algorithm based on one-class Support Vector Machine to capture rare patterns occurred in multiple data sources, nearby regions or time slots, and give a final, integrated anomaly score for each region. Evaluations based on both synthetic and real world datasets show the advantages of our method beyond baseline techniques such as distance-based, probability-based methods.},

	abstract = {Why does Zipf{\textquoteright}s law give a good description of data from seemingly completely unrelated phenomena? Here it is argued that the reason is that they can all be described as outcomes of a ubiquitous random group division: the elements can be citizens of a country and the groups family names, or the elements can be all the words making up a novel and the groups the unique words, or the elements could be inhabitants and the groups the cities in a country, and so on. A Random Group Formation (RGF) is presented from which a Bayesian estimate is obtained based on minimal information: it provides the best prediction for the number of groups with k elements, given the total number of elements, groups, and the number of elements in the largest group. For each specification of these three values, the RGF predicts a unique group distribution N (k) ? exp(-bk)/k$\gamma$, where the power-law index $\gamma$ is a unique function of the same three values. The universality of the result is made possible by the fact that no system specific assumptions are made about the mechanism responsible for the group division. The direct relation between $\gamma$ and the total number of elements, groups, and the number of elements in the largest group, is calculated. The predictive power of the RGF model is demonstrated by direct comparison with data from a variety of systems. It is shown that $\gamma$ usually takes values in the interval 1 <= $\gamma$ <= 2 and that the value for a given phenomena depends in a systematic way on the total size of the data set. The results are put in the context of earlier discussions on Zipf{\textquoteright}s and Gibrat{\textquoteright}s laws, N (k) ? k-2 and the connection between growth models and RGF is elucidated.},

This research uses metro card data from Shenzhen, China, to recognize individual mobility patterns and predict travelers' future movements. Joint entropy is proposed to measure the regularity of spatio-temporal patterns and travelers are divided into three groups, i.e. regular users, variable users and irregular users, based on the entropy value. Revised Markov chain model and hidden Markov model (HMM) are then introduced to predict individuals' future movement. We observe that the models predict with a high level of accuracy of 84.46\%, 78.79\% and 73.07\% for three groups in the HMM. This study shows the potential to predict travel patterns and enriches traditional pattern recognition and prediction methods for modeling urban mobility.

	abstract = {Location sharing services (LSS) like Foursquare, Gowalla, and Facebook Places support hundreds of millions of userdriven footprints (i.e., {\textquotedblleft}checkins{\textquotedblright}). Those global-scale footprints provide a unique opportunity to study the social and temporal characteristics of how people use these services and to model patterns of human mobility, which are significant factors for the design of future mobile+location-based services, traffic forecasting, urban planning, as well as epidemiological models of disease spread. In this paper, we investigate 22 million checkins across 220,000 users and report a quantitative assessment of human mobility patterns by analyzing the spatial, temporal, social, and textual aspects associated with these footprints. We find that: (i) LSS users follow the {\textquotedblleft}Le`vy Flight{\textquotedblright} mobility pattern and adopt periodic behaviors; (ii) While geographic and economic constraints affect mobility patterns, so does individual social status; and (iii) Content and sentiment-based analysis of posts associated with checkins can provide a rich source of context for better understanding how users engage with these services.},

The study of human mobility is especially important for applications such as estimating migratory flows, traffic forecasting, urban planning, and epidemic modeling. In this survey, we review the approaches developed to reproduce various mobility patterns, with the main focus on recent developments. This review can be used both as an introduction to the fundamental modeling principles of human mobility, and as a collection of technical methods applicable to specific mobility-related problems. The review organizes the subject by differentiating between individual and population mobility and also between short-range and long-range mobility.

An interesting issue is that the exponents of scaling law for animals and humans in different situations are quite different. This paper proposes a general optimization model, a random walker following scaling laws (whose traveling distances in each step obey a power law distribution with exponent $\alpha$) tries to diversify its visiting places under a given total traveling distance with a home-return probability. The results show that different optimal exponents in between 1 and 2 can emerge naturally. Therefore, the scaling property of human and animal mobility can be understood in our framework where the discrepancy of the scaling law exponents is due to the home-return constraint under the maximization of the visiting places diversity.},

They can be utilized as measurement devices of individual persons and for groups of people of the social context and the related interactions. The picture of human life that emerges shows complexity, which is manifested in such data in properties of the spatiotemporal tracks of individuals. We extract from smartphone-based data for a set of persons important locations such as {\textquotedblleft}home{\textquotedblright}, {\textquotedblleft}work{\textquotedblright} and so forth over fixed length time-slots covering the days in the data-set (see also [1], [2]). This set of typical places is heavy-tailed, a power-law distribution with an exponent close to -1.7. To analyze the regularities and stochastic features present, the days are classified for each person into regular, personal patterns. To this are superimposed fluctuations for each day. This randomness is measured by {\textquotedblleft}life{\textquotedblright} entropy, computed both before and after finding the clustering so as to subtract the contribution of a number of patterns. The main issue that we then address is how predictable individuals are in their mobility. The patterns and entropy are reflected in the predictability of the mobility of the life both individually and on average. We explore the simple approaches to guess the location from the typical behavior, and of exploiting the transition probabilities with time from location or activity A to B. The patterns allow an enhanced predictability, at least up to a few hours into the future from the current location. Such fixed habits are most clearly visible in the working-day length.},

Power-laws obtained from bounded sample spaces (as is the case for practically all data related problems) are always free of such limitations and maximum likelihood estimates can be obtained for arbitrary powers without restrictions. Here we first derive the appropriate ML estimator for arbitrary exponents of power-law distributions on bounded discrete sample spaces. We then show that an almost identical estimator also works perfectly for continuous data. We implemented this ML estimator and discuss its performance with previous attempts. We present a general recipe of how to use these estimators and present the associated computer codes.},

Social media has emerged as an important source for disaster managers to identify dynamic polarity of sentiments over the course of disasters, to understand human mobility patterns, and to enhance decision making and disaster recovery efforts. Although there is a growing body of literature on sentiment and human mobility in disaster contexts, the spatiotemporal characteristics of sentiment and the relationship between sentiment and mobility over time have not been investigated in detail. This study therefore addresses this research gap and proposes a new lens to evaluate population dynamics during disasters by coupling sentiment and mobility. We collected 3.74 million geotagged tweets over 8 weeks to examine individuals{\textquoteright} sentiment and mobility before, during and after the M6.0 South Napa, California Earthquake in 2014. Our research results reveal that the average sentiment level decreases with the increasing intensity of the earthquake. We found that similar levels of sentiment tended to cluster in geographical space, and this spatial autocorrelation was significant over areas of different earthquake intensities. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between temporal dynamics of sentiment and mobility. We examined the trend and seasonality of the time series and found cointegration between the series. We included effects of the earthquake and built a segmented regression model to describe the time series finding that day-to-day changes in sentiment can either lead or lag daily changed mobility patterns. This study contributes a new lens to assess the dynamic process of disaster resilience unfolding over large spatial scales.},

BSS has been deployed in many major cities around the world as a short-distance trip supplement for public transportations and private vehicles. A unique value of the bike flow data generated by these BSSs is to understand the human mobility in a short-distance trip. This understanding of the population on short-distance trip is lacking, limiting our capacity in management and operation of BSSs. Many existing operations research and management methods for BSS impose assumptions that emphasize statistical simplicity and homogeneity. Therefore, a deep understanding of the statistical patterns embedded in the bike flow data is an urgent and overriding issue to inform decision-makings for a variety of problems including traffic prediction, station placement, bike reallocation, and anomaly detection. In this paper, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the bike flow data using two large datasets collected in Chicago and Hangzhou over months. Our analysis reveals intrinsic structures of the bike flow data and regularities in both spatial and temporal scales such as a community structure and a taxonomy of the eigen-bike-flows.},

Controversy, however, exists over whether mobility patterns can be modeled in terms of a simple power law (L{\'e}vy flight model) or that more complicated power laws (exponential power law, truncated Pareto) are required. This study concentrates on two issues: testing the validity of exponential power laws and truncated Pareto distributions in urban systems to describe aggregate mobility patterns, and examining differences in mobility patterns for different travel purposes. The article describes the results of an analysis of Global Positioning System (GPS) taxi trajectory data, collected in Guangzhou, China, to identify mobility patterns in the city. The least squares statistic is used to estimate the parameters of the distribution functions. Results suggest that a fusion of functions, based on an exponential power law and a truncated Pareto distribution, represents the travel time distribution best. Moreover, the findings of this study indicate different mobility patterns to exist for different travel purposes.},

	abstract = {Spatial structure is a fundamental characteristic of cities that influences the urban functioning to a large extent. While administrative partitioning is generally done in the form of static spatial division, understanding a more temporally dynamic structure of the urban space would benefit urban planning and management immensely. This study makes use of a large-scale mobile phone positioning dataset to characterize the diurnal dynamics of the interaction-based urban spatial structure. To extract the temporally vibrant structure, spatial interaction networks at different times are constructed based on the movement connections of individuals between geographical units. Complex network community detection technique is applied to identify the spatial divisions as well as to quantify their temporal dynamics. Empirical analysis is conducted using data containing all user positions on a typical weekday in Shenzhen, China. Results are compared with official zoning and planned structure and indicate a certain degree of expansion in urban central areas and fragmentation in industrial suburban areas. A high level of variability in spatial divisions at different times of day is detected with some distinct temporal features. Peak and pre-/post-peak hours witness the most prominent fluctuation in spatial division indicating significant change in the characteristics of movements and activities during these periods of time. Findings of this study demonstrate great potential of large-scale mobility data in supporting intelligent spatial decision making and providing valuable knowledge to the urban planning sectors.},

	abstract = {Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is about detecting and describing patterns, trends, and relations in data, motivated by certain purposes of investigation. As something relevant is detected in data, new questions arise, causing specific parts to be viewed in more detail. So EDA has a significant appeal: it involves hypothesis generation rather than mere hypothesis testing. The authors describe in detail and systemize approaches, techniques, and methods for exploring spatial and temporal data in particular. They start by developing a general view of data structures and characteristics and then build on top of this a general task typology, distinguishing between elementary and synoptic tasks. This typology is then applied to the description of existing approaches and technologies, resulting not just in recommendations for choosing methods but in a set of generic procedures for data exploration. Professionals practicing analysis will profit from tested solutions {\textendash} illustrated in many examples {\textendash} for reuse in the catalogue of techniques presented. Students and researchers will appreciate the detailed description and classification of exploration techniques, which are not limited to spatial data only. In addition, the general principles and approaches described will be useful for designers of new methods for EDA.},

Traditionally, Internet service providers collect and analyze IP flow data as they present an aggregated view of traffic. In the era of mobile big data, new approaches are required to address new challenges regarding the flow characterization in the next generation wireless networks. In this article, we propose a framework for mobile big data, referred to as FMBD, which provides massive data traffic collection, storage, processing, analysis, and management functions, to cope with the tremendous amount of data traffic. In particular, by analyzing the specific characteristics of the mobile big data from flow, application, and user behavior, such as high volume, diversity of applications, and spatio-temporal distribution, our proposed FMBD demonstrates its capability to offer real data-based advice to address new challenges for future wireless networks from the viewpoints of both operators and individuals. Tested by real mobile big data, FMBD has been operational for more than five years, and can be generalized to other environments with massive data traffic or big data. Introduction},

	abstract = {People{\textquoteright}s behavior is governed by extremely complex, multidimensional processes. This fact is well-established in the transportation research community, which has been working on travel behavior (travel demand) models for many years. The number of degrees of freedom in a person{\textquoteright}s activity schedule is enormous. However, the frequency of occurrence of day-long activity schedules obeys a remarkably simple, scale-free distribution. This particular distribution has been observed in many natural and social processes and is commonly referred to as Zipf{\textquoteright}s law, a power law distribution. This research provides evidence that activity schedules from various study areas exhibit a universal power law distribution. To this end, an elaborate analysis using 13 household travel surveys from diverse study areas discusses the effect of proportional outlier removal on the power law{\textquoteright}s exponent value. Statistical evidence is provided for the hypothesis that activity schedules in all these datasets exhibit a power law distribution with a common exponent value. The study proposes that a Zipf power law could be used as an additional dimension within a travel demand model{\textquoteright}s validation process. Contrary to other validation methods, no new data is required. The observation of a Zipf power law distribution in the generated schedules appears to be a necessary condition. Additionally, the universal activity schedule distribution might enable the full integration of activity schedules in models based on universal mobility patterns.},

In this study, we compared several possible variables to verify whether a gravity model (a human mobility prediction model borrowed from Newtonian mechanics) worked as well in inner-city regions as it did in intra-city regions. We reviewed the resident population, the number of employees, and the number of SNS posts as variables for generating mass values for an urban traffic gravity model. We also compared the straight-line distance, travel distance, and the impact of time as possible distance values. We defined the functions of urban regions on the basis of public records and SNS data to reflect the diverse social factors in urban regions. In this process, we conducted a dimension reduction method for the public record data and used a machine learning-based clustering algorithm for the SNS data. In doing so, we found that functional distance could be defined as the Euclidean distance between social function vectors in urban regions. Finally, we examined whether the functional distance was a variable that had a significant impact on urban human mobility.},

Interaction and collaboration among cities offers policymakers a chance to learn how other cities are conducting climate mitigation and adaptation measures. However, activities of C2C climate networks vary. By analyzing C2C climate networks, this study aims to identify and categorize C2C networks for climate change action, and to link the functions with levels of activity. To understand C2C climate-action networks, we suggest a framework for mapping C2C: geographic bases (domestic, regional, and global C2C), linking modalities (multilateral, and institution-led C2C), and functions (information exchange, networking, lobbying and funding, research, standards and commitments provision, and monitoring and certification). Based on this framework, we analyze the contents of C2C websites to assess current activities. We find that not all C2C networks are currently active. Statistical analysis and case studies suggest that C2C climate networks with advanced functions{\textemdash}such as lobbying, research, climate plans, and monitoring{\textemdash}are likely to actively engage with member cities. However, C2C cooperation focusing mainly on networking or information sharing is less likely to survive. Policy implications suggest that well-designed and advanced C2C networks with research and monitoring functions rather than simple networking functions can enable member cities to actively engage in climate policy cooperation.},

We then investigate geographical changes in the diurnal rhythm of human activity and its local variations in different parts of the city, and between weekdays and weekend days, over 340 Chinese cities. Our results show that a city{\textquoteright}s diurnal rhythm across the whole country exhibits both regular, nationally conspicuous shifts along geographical gradients and locally distinct spatiotemporal changes within the city. Our findings could provide insights into the characterization of the daily routine of citylevel human activity and its geographical patterns, and have potential for several issues in terms of planning, management, and decision-making related to human population dynamics.},

To design, plan, and manage transportation networks, domain experts need data that reflect how people move from one place to another, at what times, for what purpose, and in what mode(s) of transportation. However, traditional data collection methods are not cost-effective or timely. For instance, travel surveys are very expensive, collected every ten years, a period of time that does not cope with quick city changes, and using a relatively small sample of people. In this paper, we propose an algorithmic pipeline to infer the distribution of mode of transportation usage in a city, using mobile phone network data. Our pipeline is based on a Topic-Supervised Non-Negative Matrix Factorization model, using a Weak-Labeling strategy on user trajectories with data obtained from open datasets, such as GTFS and OpenStreetMap. As a case study, we show results for the city of Santiago, Chile, which has a sophisticated intermodal public transportation system. Importantly, our pipeline delivers coherent results that are explainable, with interpretable parameters at each step. Finally, we discuss the potential applications and implications of such a system in transportation and urban planning.},

We identified significant locations of users such as home, work, and other based on a combined~measure of frequency, duration, time, and day of mobile phone interactions. Consecutive mobile phone records of users are used to identify stay and pass-by locations. A stay location is where users spend a significant amount of their time measured through their mobile phone usage. Trips are constructed for each user between two consecutive stay locations in a day and then categorized by purpose and time of the day. Three measures of entropy are used to further understand the regularity of user{\textquoteright}s spatiotemporal mobility patterns. The results show that user{\textquoteright}s in a high entropy cluster has high percentage of non-home based trips (77\%), and user{\textquoteright}s in a low entropy cluster has high percentage of commuting trips (49\%), indicating high regularity.~A set of doubly constrained trip distribution models is estimated. To measure travel cost, the concept of a centroid point that assumes the origins and destinations of all trips are concentrated at an arbitrary location such as the centroid of a zone is replaced by multiple origins and destinations represented by cell tower locations. Note that a cell tower location can~only be used as trips origin/destination location when a stay is detected. The travel cost measured between cell tower locations has resulted in shorter trip distances and the model estimation shows less sensitivity to the distance-decay effect.},

	abstract = {We are living in (smart) cities that hold social-oriented promises but currently, most 
of these cities disregard the humans. Although some alternatives are appearing such 
as smart citizen-centric approaches, there is a lack of how promoting truly appealing 
perspectives toward a common good or better social synergies. Thereby, smart cities, 
with their associated Information and Communication Technology tools, are offering 
new possibilities, but, unfortunately, citizens are not fully exploiting the opportunities 
to empower themselves because, among other reasons, they are not aware of their 
common spatialities. Currently, we are not able to operationalize the spatial humanurban 
interactions regarding citizens{\textquoteright} cognitions, feelings and behaviors towards city 
places (i.e., sense of place) and meaningful geographic human relationships (i.e., social 
capital). Both concepts are significant as resources for an alternative landscape 
based on human perception and organization of social interactions fostered through 
the geographic place(s). In this research, we highlight the need to understand and 
operationalize social concepts spatial dimension for a better understanding of a smart 
citizen-centric approach which is mainly dependent on our capability to understand 
platial urban dynamics. We conceptualized a (spatial) conceptual framework for sense 
of place and social capital at the individual level to study their spatial relationship in 
the urban context. We developed a web map-based survey based on the literature to 
spatialize, characterize and measure sense of place, social capital and civic engagement. 
Using the spatial data collected, we validated our framework and demonstrated the 
importance to encompass the spatial dimension of social concepts (i.e., sense of place 
and social capital) as pivotal aspect (1) to understand the platial urban dynamics; (2) 
to provide useful social-spatial data to city processes (e.g. civic engagement); and (3) 
to reveal the potential to include them in social theory and structural equation models. 
Furthermore, we highlighted the crucial role of Geographic Information Science (GISc) 
techniques to gather the spatial dimension of those social concepts. Although in this research we focus on the spatial relationship between sense of place and social capital 
on civic engagement, the possibilities to relate our framework and methodology to other 
city based-notions can bring to light new platial urban dynamics. This research wants to 
open up the agenda for further research into exploratory place-based geography studies 
and, simultaneously, sets up a common social ground to build other socially-oriented 
conceptualizations or applications on top of it.},

	abstract = {Urban mobility is known to have a relevant impact on work related car accidents especially during commuting. It is characterized by highly dynamic spatial\&ndash;temporal variability. There are open questions about the size of this phenomenon; its spatial, temporal, and demographic characteristics; and driving mechanisms. A case study is here presented for the city of Rome, Italy. High-resolution population presence and demographic data, derived from mobile phone traffic, were used. Hourly profiles of a defined mobility factor (NPM) were calculated for a gridded domain during working days and cluster analyzed to obtain mean diurnal NPM mobility patterns. Age distributions of the population were calculated from demographic data to get insight in the type of population involved in mobility, and spatially linked with the mobility patterns. Census data about production units and their employees were related with the classified NPM mobility patterns. Seven different NPM mobility patterns were identified and mapped over the study area. The mobility slightly deviates from the census-based demography (0.15 on average, in a range of 0 to 1). The number of employees per 100 inhabitants was found to be the main driving mechanism of mobility. Finally, contributions of people employed in different economic macrocategories were assigned to each mobility time-pattern. Results provide a deeper knowledge of urban dynamics and their driving mechanisms in Rome.},

In countries with emerging economies, the reduction in urban mobility has emerged as a major problem that affects both the economy and people's quality of life. The mobility difficulties faced in cities differ between men and women. This study uses the Individual Differences to Gender and IT (IDTGIT) theory and investigates how individual differences influence the behavior of urban mobility service technology use. The research includes qualitatively structured interviews, questionnaires, and demonstrations. The results show the influence of individual characteristics and present five profiles of women in relation to their behaviors. This study enriches theory by demonstrating a new way to analyze this phenomenon By focusing on practice, the study contributes to the information available for companies seeking to facilitate access to urban mobility services and companies related to urban transport services.},

	abstract = {Given a network, can we visualize it for any given task, highlighting the important characteristics? Networks are widespread, and hence summarizing and visualizing them is of primary interest for many applications such as viral marketing, extracting communities and immunization. Summaries can help in solving new problems in visualization, sense-making, and in many other goals. However, most prior work focuses on generic structural summarization techniques or on developing specific algorithms for specific tasks. This is both tedious and challenging. As a result, for several popular tasks, there do not exist readymade summarization methods. In this paper, we explore a promising alternative approach instead. We propose NetGist, a framework which automatically learns how to generate a summary for a given task on a given network. In addition to generating the required summary, this also allows us to reuse the learned process on other similar networks. We formulate a novel task-based graph summarization problem and leverage reinforcement learning to design a flexible framework for our solution. Via extensive experiments, we show that NetGist robustly and effectively learns meaningful summaries, and helps solve challenging problems, and aids in complex task-based sense-making of networks.},

	abstract = {Inferring social relationships from user location data has become increasingly important for real-world applications, such as recommendation, advertisement targeting, and transportation scheduling. Most existing mobility relationship measures are based on pairwise meeting frequency, that it, the more frequently two users meet (i.e., co-locate at the same time), the more likely that they are friends. However, such frequency-based methods suffer greatly from data sparsity challenge. Due to data collection limitation and bias in the real world (e.g., check-in data), the observed meeting events between two users might be very few. On the other hand, existing methods focus too much on the interactions between two users, but fail to incorporate the whole social network structure. For example, the relationship propagation is not well utilized in existing methods. In this paper, we propose to construct a user graph based on their spatial-temporal interactions and employ graph embedding technique to learn user representations from such a graph. The similarity measure of such representations can well describe mobility relationship and it is particularly useful to describe the similarity for user pairs with low or even zero meeting frequency. Furthermore, we introduce semantic information on meeting events by using point-of-interest (POI) categorical information. Additionally, when part of the social graph is available as friendship ground truth, we can easily encode such online social network information through a joint graph embedding. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

This paper systematically compares a set of surface transportation network structure variables (connectivity, hierarchy, circuity, treeness, entropy, accessibility) across the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. A set of scaling parameters are discovered to show how network size and structure vary with city size. These results suggest that larger cities are physically more inter-connected. Hypotheses are presented as to why this might obtain. This paper then consistently measures and ranks access to jobs across 50 US metropolitan areas. It uses that accessibility measure, along with network structure variables and city size to help explain journey-to-work time and auto mode share in those cities. A 1 percent increase in accessibility reduces average metropolitan commute times by about 90 seconds each way. A 1 percent increase in network connectivity reduces commute time by 0.1 percent. A 1 percent increase in accessibility results in a 0.0575 percent drop in auto mode share, while a 1 percent increase in treeness reduces auto mode share by 0.061 percent. Use of accessibility and network structure measures is important for planning and evaluating the performance of network investments and land use changes.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Existing urban boundaries are usually defined by government agencies for administrative, economic, and political purposes. However, it is not clear whether the boundaries truly reflect human interactions with urban space in intraand inter-regional activities. Defining urban boundaries that consider socioeconomic relationships and citizen commute patterns is important for many aspects of urban and regional planning. In this paper, we describe a method to delineate urban boundaries based upon human interactions with physical space inferred from social media. Specifically, we depicted the urban boundaries of Great Britain using a mobility network of Twitter user spatial interactions, which was inferred from over 69 million geo-located tweets. We define the nonadministrative anthropographic boundaries in a hierarchical fashion based on different physical movement ranges of users derived from the collective mobility patterns of Twitter users in Great Britain. The results of strongly connected urban regions in the form of communities in the network space yield geographically cohesive, non-overlapping urban areas, which provide a clear delineation of the non-administrative anthropographic urban boundaries of Great Britain. The method was applied to both national (Great Britain) and municipal scales (the London metropolis). While our results corresponded well with the administrative boundaries, many unexpected and interesting boundaries were identified. Importantly, as the depicted urban boundaries exhibited a strong instance of spatial proximity, we employed a gravity model to understand the distance decay effects in shaping the delineated urban boundaries. The model explains how geographical distances found in the mobility patterns affect the interaction intensity among different non-administrative anthropographic urban areas, which provides new insights into human spatial interactions with urban space.},

	abstract = {The emergence of a complex language is one of the fundamental events of human evolution, and several remarkable features suggest the presence of fundamental principles of organization. These principles seem to be common to all languages. The best known is the so-called Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of a word decays as a (universal) power law of its rank. The possible origins of this law have been controversial, and its meaningfulness is still an open question. In this article, the early hypothesis of Zipf of a principle of least effort for explaining the law is shown to be sound. Simultaneous minimization in the effort of both hearer and speaker is formalized with a simple optimization process operating on a binary matrix of signal{\textendash}object associations. Zipf's law is found in the transition between referentially useless systems and indexical reference systems. Our finding strongly suggests that Zipf's law is a hallmark of symbolic reference and not a meaningless feature. The implications for the evolution of language are discussed. We explain how language evolution can take advantage of a communicative phase transition.},

However, they often lack some of the key information including the purposes of trips for each individual user. Information on trip purposes is crucial for projecting the future travel patterns as well as understanding the characteristics of each area of a city and how it is changing. This paper proposes a method called EAT-CD (Extraction of Activity Types and Change Detection). It estimates the volume of passengers by activity types (e.g. commuting, leisure) using non-negative matrix factorization and detects changes in the number of visitors for each activity (e.g. increase in shopping trips triggered by the development of a new commercial facility). Validity of EAT-CD is tested through empirical analysis using smart card data of public transportation in Western Japan. The results showed that EAT-CD is effective in deriving activity patterns, which showed strong correlation with travel survey data. The results also confirmed that EAT-CD detects changes in travel patterns (e.g. start and end of semesters) and land uses (e.g. establishment of new facilities).},

In this paper, we proposed a novel tensor factorization approach to modeling city dynamics in a basic life pattern space (CitySpectral Space). To obtain the CitySpectrum, we utilized Non-negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) to decompose a people flow tensor into basic life pattern tensors, described by three bases i.e. the intensity variation among different regions, the time-of-day and the sample days. We apply our approach to a big mobile phone GPS log dataset (containing 1.6 million users) to model the fluctuation in people flow before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake from a CitySpectral perspective. In addition, our framework is extensible to a variety of auxiliary spatial-temporal data. We parametrize a people flow with a spatial distribution of the Points of Interest (POIs) to quantitatively analyze the relationship between human mobility and POI distribution. Based on the parametric people flow, we propose a spectral approach for a site-selection recommendation and people flow simulation in another similar area using POI distribution.},

Broad, extensive, and multidisciplinary research has been devoted to the extraction of non-trivial knowledge from this novel form of data. We propose a general method to determine the influence of social and mobility behavior over a specific geographical area in order to evaluate to what extent the current administrative borders represent the real basin of human movement. We build a network representation of human movement starting with vehicle GPS tracks and extract relevant clusters, which are then mapped back onto the territory, finding a good match with the existing administrative borders. The novelty of our approach is the focus on a detailed spatial resolution, we map emerging borders in terms of individual municipalities, rather than macro regional or national areas. We present a series of experiments to illustrate and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Reputation is an important social construct in science, which enables informed quality assessments of both publications and careers of scientists in the absence of complete systemic information. However, the relation between reputation and career growth of an individual remains poorly understood, despite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here, we develop an original framework for measuring how a publication{\textquoteright}s citation rate $\Delta$c depends on the reputation of its central author i, in addition to its net citation count c. To estimate the strength of the reputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450 highly cited scientists, using the total citations Ci of each scientist as his/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover c{\texttimes}, which distinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with c {\textless} c{\texttimes}, the author{\textquoteright}s reputation is found to dominate the annual citation rate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage corresponding to roughly a 66\% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold increase in Ci. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for highly cited publications meaning that, for c >= c{\texttimes}, the citation rate measures scientific impact more transparently. In addition, we have developed a stochastic reputation model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical observations for real careers, thus providing insight into the microscopic mechanisms underlying cumulative advantage in science.},

Compared to census-data-based studies, data collected from broadly used location-awareness devices enable us to describe migrant patterns with timely and fine spatial resolutions. Using a mobile positioning dataset, this paper first analyzes the spatial patterns of mobile-data-based active population estimation (MAPE) and aims to uncover the socioeconomic factors associated with migrant patterns based on the MAPE change around the Chinese Spring Festival of 2016. Time series analysis presents obvious regular patterns and characteristics of MAPE before and during the holiday. Results from a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model show that MAPE differences are significantly associated with the development of secondary and tertiary industries, wage levels and foreign investments. Spatial disparities of the GWR model coefficients reveal that areas in China have different degrees of association with the explanatory variables. Explanations of this spatial nonstationary phenomenon are further detailed with the perspective of a geographical background. Finally, associated social and economic development strategies among cities in China are analyzed, and policy implications regarding the newly emerged data and their insightful findings are discussed.},

In parallel, mobile phone data have emerged as the largest mobility data source, but are not yet integrated to transport planning models. Currently, transport authorities are lacking a global picture of daily passenger flows on multimodal transport networks. In this work, we propose the first methodology to infer dynamic Origin-Destination flows by transport modes using mobile network data e.g., Call Detail Records. For this study, we pre-process 360 million trajectories for more than 2 million devices from the Greater Paris as our case study region. The model combines mobile network geolocation with transport network geospatial data, travel survey, census and travel card data. The transport modes of mobile network trajectories are identified through a two-steps semi-supervised learning algorithm. The later involves clustering of mobile network areas and Bayesian inference to generate transport probabilities for trajectories. After attributing the mode with highest probability to each trajectory, we construct Origin-Destination matrices by transport mode. Flows are up-scaled to the total population using state-of-the-art expansion factors. The model generates time variant road and rail passenger flows for the complete region. From our results, we observe different mobility patterns for road and rail modes and between Paris and its suburbs. The resulting transport flows are extensively validated against the travel survey and the travel card data for different spatial scales.},

However, it presents some challenges due to its spatio-temporal characteristics and sparseness. Therefore, in this article, we introduced a new model to refine the positioning accuracy of mobile devices using only CDR data and coverage areas locations. The adopted method has three steps: first, we discovered which model of movement (Move, Stay) is associated with the coverage areas where the mobile device was connected using a Kalman filter. Then, simultaneously we estimated the location or the position of the device. Finally, we applied map-matching to bring the positioning to the right road segment. The results are very encouraging; nevertheless, there is some enhancement that can be done at the level of movement models and map matching. For example by introducing more sophisticated movement model based on data-driven modeling and a map matching that uses the movement model type detected by matching Stay location to buildings and Move model to roads.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to solve an inverse problem which regards a mass moving in a bounded domain. We assume that the mass moves following an unknown velocity field and that the evolution of the mass density can be described by a partial differential equation, which is also unknown. The input data of the problems are given by some snapshots of the mass distribution at certain times, while the sought output is the velocity field that drives the mass along its displacement. To this aim, we put in place an algorithm based on the combination of two methods: first, we use the Dynamic Mode Decomposition to create a mathematical model describing the mass transfer; second, we use the notion of Wasserstein distance (also known as earth mover{\textquoteright}s distance) to reconstruct the underlying velocity field that is responsible for the displacement. Finally, we consider a real-life application: the algorithm is employed to study the travel flows of people in large populated areas using, as input data, density profiles (i.e. the spatial distribution) of people in given areas at different time instances. This kind of data are provided by the Italian telecommunication company TIM and are derived by mobile phone usage.},

	abstract = {Complex networks have been studied extensively due to their relevance to many real systems as diverse as the World-Wide-Web (WWW), the Internet, energy landscapes, biological and social networks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. A large number of real networks are called {\textquotedblleft}scale-free{\textquotedblright} because they show a power-law distribution of the number of links per node [1, 6, 7]. However, it is widely believed that complex networks are not length-scale invariant or self-similar. This conclusion originates from the {\textquotedblleft}small-world{\textquotedblright} property of these networks, which implies that the number of nodes increases exponentially with the {\textquotedblleft}diameter{\textquotedblright} of the network [8, 9, 10, 11], rather than the power-law relation expected for a self-similar structure. Nevertheless, here we present a novel approach to the analysis of such networks, revealing that their structure is indeed self-similar. This result is achieved by the application of a renormalization procedure which coarse-grains the system into boxes containing nodes within a given {\textquotedblright}size{\textquotedblright}. Concurrently, we identify a power-law relation between the number of boxes needed to cover the network and the size of the box defining a finite self-similar exponent. These fundamental properties, which are shown for the WWW, social, cellular and protein-protein interaction networks, help to understand the emergence of the scale-free property in complex networks. They suggest a common self-organization dynamics of diverse networks at different scales into a critical state and in turn bring together previously unrelated fields: the statistical physics of complex networks with renormalization group, fractals and critical phenomena.},

	abstract = {What determines the timing of human actions? A big question, but the science of human dynamics is here to tackle it. And its predictions are of practical value: for example, when ISPs decide what bandwidth an institution needs, they use a model of the likely timing and activity level of the individuals. Current models assume that an individual has a well defined probability of engaging in a specific action at a given moment, but evidence that the timing of human actions does not follow this pattern (of Poisson statistics) is emerging. Instead the delay between two consecutive events is best described by a heavy-tailed (power law) distribution. Albert-L{\'a}szl{\'o} Barab{\'a}si proposes an explanation for the prevalence of this behaviour. The {\textquoteleft}bursty{\textquoteright} nature of human dynamics, he finds, is a fundamental consequence of decision making.},

	title = {The {Four} {Step} {Model}},
	url = {https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0r75311t},
	abstract = {The history of demand modeling for person travel has been dominated by the modeling approach that has come to be referred to as the four step model (FSM) (see Chapter 2). Travel, always viewed in theory as derived from the demand for activity participation, in practice has been modeled with trip-based rather than activity-based methods (as presented in Chapter 4). Trip origin-destination (O-D) rather than activity surveys form the principle database. The influence of activity characteristics decreases, and that of trip characteristics increases, as the conventional forecasting sequence proceeds. The application of this modeling approach is near universal, as in large measure are its criticisms (these inadequacies are well documented, e.g., by McNally and Recker (1986)). The current FSM might best be viewed in two stages. In the first stage, various characteristics of the traveler and the land use - activity system (and to a varying degree, the transportation system) are "evaluated, calibrated, and validated" to produce a non-equilibrated measure of travel demand (or trip tables). In the second stage, this demand is loaded onto the transportation network in a process than amounts to formal equilibration of route choice only, not of other choice dimensions such as destination, mode, time-of-day, or whether to travel at all (feedback to prior stages has often been introduced, but not in a consistent and convergent manner). Although this approach has been moderately successful in the aggregate, it has failed to perform in most relevant policy tests, whether on the demand or supply side.This chapter extends the material in Chapter 2 by providing a concise overview of the mechanics of the FSM, illustrated with a hypothetical case study. The discussion in this chapter, however, will focus on U.S. modeling practice. Transportation modeling developed as a component of the process of transportation analysis that came to be established in the U.S.A. during the era of post-war development and economic growth. Initial application of analytical methods began in the 1950s. The landmark study of Mitchell and Rapkin (1954) not only established the link of travel and activities (or land use) but called for a comprehensive framework and inquiries into travel behavior. The initial development of models of trip generation, distribution, and diversion in the early 1950s lead to the first comprehensive application of the four-step model system in the Chicago Area Transportation Study (see Weiner, 1997) with the model sandwiched by land use projection and economic evaluation. The focus was decidedly highway-oriented with new facilities being evaluated versus traffic engineering improvements. The 1960s brought federal legislation requiring "continuous, comprehensive, and cooperative" urban transportation planning, fully institutionalizing the FSM. Further legislation in the 1970s brought environmental concerns to planning and modeling, as well as the need for multimodal planning. It was recognized that the existing model system may not be appropriate for application to emerging policy concerns and, in what might be referred to as the "first travel model improvement program", a call for improved models led to research and the development of disaggregate travel demand forecasting and equilibrium assignment methods that integrated well with the FSM and have greatly directed modeling approaches for most of the last 30 years. The late 1970s brought "quick response" approaches to travel forecasting (Sosslau et al., 1978; Martin and McGuckin, 1998) and independently the start of what has grown to become the activity-based approach (see Chapter 4). The growing recognition of the misfit of the FSM and relevant policy questions in the 1980s led to the (second, but formal) Travel Model Improvement Program in 1991; much of the subsequent period has been directed at improving the state-of-thepractice relative to the conventional model while fostering research and development in new methodologies to further the state-of-the-art (see Chapter 4).The FSM is best seen as a particular application of transportation systems analysis (TSA), a framework due to Manheim (1979) and Florian et al. (1988), which positions the model well to view its strengths and weaknesses. A brief presentation of this TSA framework introduces the FSM context and leads to a discussion of problem and study area definition, model application, and data requirements. The models that are perhaps most commonly utilized in the FSM are then presented in the form of a sample application.},

Bennett finds that my case of n = 3 can really be solved by elliptic integrals, and, of course, Lord Rayleigh's solution for n very large is most valuable, and may very probably suffice for the purposes I have immediately in view. I ought to have known it, but my reading of late years has drifted into other channels, and one does not expect to find the first stage in a biometric problem provided in a memoir on sound. From the purely mathematical standpoint, it would still be very interesting to have a solution for n comparatively small. The sections through the axis of Lord Rayleigh's frequency surface for n large are simply the {\textquotedblleft}cocked hat{\textquotedblright} or normal curve of errors type; for n = 2 or 3 they do not resemble this form at all. For n=2, for example, the sections are of the form of a double U, thus UU, the whole being symmetrical about the centre vertical corresponding to r = 0, but each U itself being asymmetrical. The system has three vertical asymptotes. It would be interesting to see how the multiplicity of types for n small passes over into the normal curve of errors when n is made large.},

Information used for extracting patterns is extracted from only location data. In this research, a land-use pattern is defined as how the area is used throughout a day. We extract the land-use patterns based on temporal transition in the number of people in the area. In petterns extraction, a clustering technique with an infinite Gaussian mixture model with Dirichlet process mixtures is used, which can be used to discover the appropriate number of patterns. Experiments were conducted in 34 areas over 56 consecutive days. This means 1,904 conditions were studied. The results of our experiments show that our approach successfully extracts land-use patterns using the temporal transition in a population. The results also reveal that additional features which are estimated only from spatio-temporal data helps us control the extracted patterns.},

In ecology, biology, and many physical and social sciences, the exponents of these power laws are estimated to draw inference about the processes underlying the phenomenon, to test theoretical models, and to scale up from local observations to global patterns. Therefore, it is essential that these exponents be estimated accurately. Unfortunately, the binning-based methods traditionally used in ecology and other disciplines perform quite poorly. Here we discuss more sophisticated methods for fitting these exponents based on cumulative distribution functions and maximum likelihood estimation. We illustrate their superior performance at estimating known exponents and provide details on how and when ecologists should use them. Our results confirm that maximum likelihood estimation outperforms other methods in both accuracy and precision. Because of the use of biased statistical methods for estimating the exponent, the conclusions of several recently published papers should be revisited.]},

It brings together a number of distinguished contributors, each of whom examines a particular aspect of Ireland's diverse cultural geography and history. Issues covered include: the changing definitions of Irishness the roles of class and gender in constructing traditional alignments of identity the role of ethnicity in Irish society the invention and imagining of Irish 'place' the political implications of a pluralistic Ireland The contributors demonstrate that many people both inside and outside of Ireland continue to define themselves and their conflicts through simple sectarian stereotypes. The authors argue that politicians and others must reject these outdated either/or representations and accommodate instead the fluidity of Irish identity.

Beginning with a powerful critique of historicism and its constraining effects on the geographical imagination, Edward Soja builds on the work of Foucault, Berger, Giddens, Berman, Jameson and, above all, Henri Lefebvre, to argue for a historical and geographical materialism, a radical rethinking of the dialectics of space, time and social being.  Soja charts the respatialization of social theory from the still unfolding encounter between Western Marxism and modern geography, through the current debates on the emergence of a postfordist regime of "flexible accumulation." The postmodern geography of Los Angeles, exposed in a provocative pair of essays, serves as a model in his account of the contemporary struggle for control over the social production of space.},

	abstract = {Conditions for travel have changed and are still changing the world a world experiencing what John Urry calls the mobility turn . Since World War Two we have been moving faster and going further a fact that has profoundly changed our way of experiencing both the world and ourselves. The explosion of low-cost travel options has similarly had an important impact on the economy, adding to the globalization of markets and transformations in modes of production. It is no longer possible to think of nation-states as autonomous vis-a-vis one another, nor of cities or regions as homogenous spaces delimited by clear-cut borders. Societies, like Western cities, are redefining themselves through mobility. What does this mean for the city for its governability and governance? In this book Vincent Kaufmann assesses the urban implications of the mobility turn. He explores the modern urban phenomenon from the point of view of the mobility capacities of its players their motility. He asks that the reader consider the idea of a city or region as the product or an arrangement of a specific set of motilities. Re-Thinking the City seeks to identify how the motility of individuals, goods, and information acts as an organizing principle or rather, the organizing principle of contemporary urban change, and then aims to examine the consequences for urban governance by exploring the channels through which individual and collective motility can be regulated.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks {\textquoteleft}rewired{\textquoteright} to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them {\textquoteleft}small-world{\textquoteright} networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

We use a weighted network representation where vertices correspond to towns and the edges to the actual commuting flows among those. We characterize quantitatively both the topological and weighted properties of the resulting network. Interestingly, the statistical properties of commuting traffic exhibit complex features and non-trivial relations with the underlying topology. We characterize quantitatively the traffic backbone among large cities and we give evidences for a very high heterogeneity of the commuter flows around large cities. We also discuss the interplay between the topological and dynamical properties of the network as well as their relation with socio-demographic variables such as population and monthly income. This analysis may be useful at various stages in environmental planning and provides analytical tools for a wide spectrum of applications ranging from impact evaluation to decision-making and planning support.},

Models, based on these interactions, can be used in optimizing traffic flow, slowing the spread of infectious diseases, or predicting the change in cell phone usage in a disaster. We analyzed cumulative and aggregated data generated from the simulated movements of 1.6 x 10(6) individuals in a computer (pseudo-agent-based) model during a typical day in Portland, Oregon. This city is mapped into a graph with 181,206 nodes representing physical locations such as buildings. Connecting edges model individual's flow between nodes. Edge weights are constructed from the daily traffic of individuals moving between locations. The number of edges leaving a node (out-degree), the edge weights (out-traffic), and the edge weights per location (total out-traffic) are fitted well by power-law distributions. The power-law distributions also fit subgraphs based on work, school, and social/recreational activities. The resulting weighted graph is a "small world" and has scaling laws consistent with an underlying hierarchical structure. We also explore the time evolution of the largest connected component and the distribution of the component sizes. We observe a strong linear correlation between the out-degree and total out-traffic distributions and significant levels of clustering. We discuss how these network features can be used to characterize social networks and their relationship to dynamic processes.},

Verifying that potential clusterings are real in some objective sense is receiving more attention as the number of new clustering algorithms and their applications grow. We consider one aspect of this question and study the stability of a hierarchical structure with a variation on a measure of stability proposed in the literature.(1,2) Our measure of stability is appropriate for proximity matrices whose entries are on an ordinal scale. We randomly split the data set, cluster the two halves, and compare the two hierarchical clusterings with the clustering achieved on the entire data set. Two stability statistics, based on the Goodman-Kruskal rank correlation coefficient, are defined. The distributions of these statistics are estimated with Monte Carlo techniques for two clustering methods (single-link and complete-link) and under two conditions (randomly selected proximity matrices and proximity matrices with good hierarchical structure). The stability measures are applied to some real data sets.},

In this article, we consider the question of whether there is a relationship between the data provided by Foursquare regarding users{\textquoteright} tastes and preferences and fieldwork carried out in cities, especially those connected with business and leisure. Murcia was chosen for case study for two reasons: its particular characteristics and the prior knowledge resulting from the fieldwork. Since users of this network establish, what may be called, a ranking of places through their recommendations, we can plot these data with the objective of displaying the characteristics and peculiarities of the network in this city. Fieldwork from the city itself gives us a set of facilities and services observed in the city, which is a physical reality. An analysis of these data using a model based on a network centrality algorithm establishes a classification or ranking of the nodes that form the urban network. We compare the data extracted from the social network with the data collected from the fieldwork, in order to establish the appropriateness in terms of understanding the activity that takes place in this city. Moreover, this comparison allows us to draw conclusions about the degree of similarity between the preferences of Foursquare users and what was obtained through the fieldwork in the city.},

	abstract = {Activity space is an important concept in geography. Recent advancements of location-aware technologies have generated many useful spatiotemporal data sets for studying human activity space for large populations. In this article, we use two actively tracked cellphone location data sets that cover a weekday to characterize people's use of space in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. We introduce three mobility indicators (daily activity range, number of activity anchor points, and frequency of movements) to represent the major determinants of individual activity space. By applying association rules in data mining, we analyze how these indicators of an individual's activity space can be combined with each other to gain insights of mobility patterns in these two cities. We further examine spatiotemporal variations of aggregate mobility patterns in these two cities. Our results reveal some distinctive characteristics of human activity space in these two cities: (1) A high percentage of people in Shenzhen have a relatively short daily activity range, whereas people in Shanghai exhibit a variety of daily activity ranges; (2) people with more than one activity anchor point tend to travel further but less frequently in Shanghai than in Shenzhen; (3) Shenzhen shows a significant north{\textendash}south contrast of activity space that reflects its urban structure; and (4) travel distance in both cities is shorter around noon than in regular work hours, and a large percentage of movements around noon are associated with individual home locations. This study indicates the benefits of analyzing actively tracked cellphone location data for gaining insights of human activity space in different cities.},

	abstract = {Distance decay is a primary characteristic of spatial interaction in human movements, and it has been incorporated into many spatial interaction models. Existing approaches mainly rely on travel survey datasets to fit the frictional coefficient of distance decay. However, limited sample size and spatiotemporal resolution make the determination of the spatial interaction characteristic from a comprehensive view difficult. Recently, this situation has been reversed due to emerging large human trajectory datasets, which have stimulated a body of literatures to re-examine the traditional issue of distance decay. However, these studies only focused on distance decay from a global perspective and neglected the spatial non-stationarity of spatial interaction. This study aims to reveal the spatial heterogeneity of distance decay of human movements extracted from massive mobile phone location data from Shenzhen, China. The power law function is utilized to fit the distance decay coefficients for inflow and outflow of each spatial analysis unit. Then, geographically weighted regression is employed to quantify the relationship between distance decay coefficients and land use distribution and between distance decay coefficients and traffic facilities. Results show that considerable spatial non-stationarity appears in the distance decay of spatial interaction, and the regression coefficients indicate the spatial variations of the influence of land use and traffic facilities on distance decay across urban space. These findings provide an in-depth insight into the distance decay characteristics of human movements in a more microcosmic space.},

Modeling these systems is a real challenge and triggered the interest of many disciplines such as quantitative geography, spatial economics, geomatics and urbanism, and more recently physics. (Statistical) Physics plays a major role by bringing tools and concepts able to bridge theory and empirical results, and we will illustrate this on some fundamental aspects of cities: the growth of their surface area and their population, their spatial organization, and the spatial distribution of activities. We will present state-of-the-art results and models but also open problems for which we still have a partial understanding and where physics approaches could be particularly helpful. We will end this short review with a discussion about the possibility of constructing a science of cities.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04314},
	abstract = {In the classic model of first passage percolation, for pairs of vertices separated by a Euclidean distance \$L\$, geodesics exhibit deviations from their mean length \$L\$ that are of order \$L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}chi\$, while the transversal fluctuations, known as wandering, grow as \$L{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}xi\$. We find that when weighting edges directly with their Euclidean span in various spatial network models, we have two distinct classes defined by different exponents \${\textbackslash}xi=3/5\$ and \${\textbackslash}chi = 1/5\$, or \${\textbackslash}xi=7/10\$ and \${\textbackslash}chi = 2/5\$, depending only on coarse details of the specific connectivity laws used. Also, the travel time fluctuations are Gaussian, rather than Tracy-Widom, which is rarely seen in first passage models. The first class contains proximity graphs such as the hard and soft random geometric graph, and the \$k\$-nearest neighbour random geometric graphs, where via Monte Carlo simulations we find \${\textbackslash}xi=0.60{\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$ and \${\textbackslash}chi = 0.20{\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$, showing a theoretical minimal wandering. The second class contains graphs based on excluded regions such as \${\textbackslash}beta\$-skeletons and the Delaunay triangulation and are characterised by the values \${\textbackslash}xi=0.70{\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$ and \${\textbackslash}chi = 0.40{\textbackslash}pm 0.01\$, with a nearly theoretically maximal wandering exponent. We also show numerically that the KPZ relation \${\textbackslash}chi = 2{\textbackslash}xi -1\$ is satisfied for all these models. These results shed some light on the Euclidean first passage process, but also raise some theoretical questions about the scaling laws and the derivation of the exponent values, and also whether a model can be constructed with maximal wandering, or non-Gaussian travel fluctuations, while embedded in space.},

	abstract = {Urban flow monitoring systems play important roles in smart city efforts around the world. However, the ubiquitous deployment of monitoring devices, such as CCTVs, induces a long-lasting and enormous cost for maintenance and operation. This suggests the need for a technology that can reduce the number of deployed devices, while preventing the degeneration of data accuracy and granularity. In this paper, we aim to infer the real-time and fine-grained crowd flows throughout a city based on coarse-grained observations. This task is challenging due to two reasons: the spatial correlations between coarse- and fine-grained urban flows, and the complexities of external impacts. To tackle these issues, we develop a method entitled UrbanFM based on deep neural networks. Our model consists of two major parts: 1) an inference network to generate fine-grained flow distributions from coarse-grained inputs by using a feature extraction module and a novel distributional upsampling module; 2) a general fusion subnet to further boost the performance by considering the influences of different external factors. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, namely TaxiBJ and HappyValley, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared to seven baselines, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance of our approach on the fine-grained urban flow inference problem.},

Our analysis yields several practical insights, including the following: (1) We identified trajectories of Twitter users moving out of evacuation zones once the evacuation was ordered and then returning home after the hurricane passed. (2) Evacuation zone residents produced an unusually large number of tweets outside evacuation zones during the evacuation order period. (3) It took several days for the evacuees in both South Carolina and Georgia to leave their residential areas after the mandatory evacuation was ordered, but Georgia residents typically took more time to return home. (4) Evacuees are more likely to choose larger cities farther away as their destinations for safety instead of nearby small cities. (5) Human movements during the evacuation follow a log-normal distribution.},

	abstract = {This article provides an analysis of the concepts of movement and mobility within the context of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) for patients{\textquoteright} functioning, disability, and health. The methodology developed by Walker and Avant was used to clarify definitions, components, and relationships relevant to the 2 concepts and to the elements of the ICF framework. Definitions and the relationship between concepts are key information that clinicians and researchers need to measure the correct concept when they are assessing the effectiveness of interventions in nursing practice. Concept analysis findings are grounded by the notion that movement occurs when the body causes its own displacement and is explained by the basic principles of physics, human anatomy, and physiology. Mobility is then distinct because it is affected by the environment that the individual is in and can be assisted by any type of mobility aid. Mobility does not need to be generated by the individual's muscles but does need to be controlled by the individual who is mobile. An individual's mobility in his or her environment is important to his or her well-being and needs to be understood in relationship to his or her movements.},

This article discusses the existing challenges and the recent advances to overcome them and allow sharing information across stakeholders of crowd management through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. The article proposes the usage of the new federated interoperable semantic IoT platform (FIESTA-IoT), which is considered as "a system of systems." The platform can support various IoT applications for crowd management in smart cities. In particular, the article discusses two integrated IoT systems for crowd mobility: the Crowd Mobility Analytics System and the Crowd Counting and Location System (from the SmartSantander testbed). Pilot studies are conducted in the Gold Coast, Australia, and Santander, Spain, to fulfill various requirements such as providing online and offline crowd mobility analyses with various sensors in different regions. The analyses provided by these systems are shared across applications in order to provide insights and support crowd management in smart city environments.},

	abstract = {The multi-modal transportation problem is a type of shortest path problem (SPP). Its goal is to find the best path between two points in a network with more than one means of transportation. This network can be modeled using a weighted directed colored graph. Hence, an optimization method can be applied to find a better path between two nodes. There are some digital applications, like the well-known Google Maps, that present solution to this problem. Most of them choose the best path according to one objective function: the minimum travel time. However, this optimization process can consider multiple objective functions if different user{\textquoteright}s interests are treated in the model such as the cheapest or the most comfortable path. In this work, we implemented and compared two different approaches of algorithms with multiple objectives. One of them is an exact method based on Dijkstra{\textquoteright}s algorithm added by sum weight method, and the other one is a heuristic approach based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The computational results of the two methods were compared. The comparison shows that the heuristic method is promising due to the low execution time{\textemdash}around 20 s{\textemdash}and the quality of the results. This quality was measured by the closeness of the points found by the two methods in the objective domain. The runtime and the quality of the results can indicate that this modeling is suitable to a real-time problem, for instance, the multi-modal transportation problem.},

	abstract = {At present, the detection of urban community structures is mainly based on existing administrative divisions, and is performed using qualitative methods. The lack of quantitative methods makes it difficult to judge the rationality of urban community divisions. In this study, we used complex network association mining methods to detect a city community structure by using the Origin-Destinations (OD) at traffic analysis zone (TAZ) level, and successively assigned all the TAZs into different communities. Based on the community results, we calculated the community core degree of each TAZ within every community, and then calculated the Traffic Core Degree and Location Core Degree indicators of the community based on OD passenger flow and spatial location relationship between communities. Finally, we analyzed the correlation among three indicators to ensure the rationality of the community structure. We used the city of Zhengzhou in 2016 as an example case study. For Zhengzhou, we detected a total of six communities. We found a relatively low correlation between Traffic Core Degree and Location Core Degree. Within each group, the correlation between community core degree and Traffic Core Degree was higher than that between community core degree and Location Core Degree, indicating that the urban community structure is more reasonably based on traffic characteristics. The development of a quantitative approach for determining reasonable city community structures has important implications for transportation planning and industrial layout.},

	abstract = {With the fast development of various positioning techniques such as Global Position System (GPS), mobile devices and remote sensing, spatio-temporal data has become increasingly available nowadays. Mining valuable knowledge from spatio-temporal data is critically important to many real world applications including human mobility understanding, smart transportation, urban planning, public safety, health care and environmental management. As the number, volume and resolution of spatio-temporal datasets increase rapidly, traditional data mining methods, especially statistics based methods for dealing with such data are becoming overwhelmed. Recently, with the advances of deep learning techniques, deep leaning models such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) have enjoyed considerable success in various machine learning tasks due to their powerful hierarchical feature learning ability in both spatial and temporal domains, and have been widely applied in various spatio-temporal data mining (STDM) tasks such as predictive learning, representation learning, anomaly detection and classification. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on recent progress in applying deep learning techniques for STDM. We first categorize the types of spatio-temporal data and briefly introduce the popular deep learning models that are used in STDM. Then a framework is introduced to show a general pipeline of the utilization of deep learning models for STDM. Next we classify existing literatures based on the types of ST data, the data mining tasks, and the deep learning models, followed by the applications of deep learning for STDM in different domains including transportation, climate science, human mobility, location based social network, crime analysis, and neuroscience. Finally, we conclude the limitations of current research and point out future research directions.},

In this study, we present a framework to describe the dynamics of congestion propagation and dissipation of traffic in cities using a simple contagion process, inspired by those used to model infectious disease spread in a population. We introduce two novel macroscopic characteristics of network traffic, namely congestion propagation rate {\textbackslash}b\{eta\} and congestion dissipation rate \{{\textbackslash}mu\}. We describe the dynamics of congestion propagation and dissipation using these new parameters, {\textbackslash}b\{eta\}, and \{{\textbackslash}mu\}, embedded within a system of ordinary differential equations, analogous to the well-known Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model. The proposed contagion-based dynamics are verified through an empirical multi-city analysis, and can be used to monitor, predict and control the fraction of congested links in the network over time.},

However, the knowledge and framework for data use for smart cities remain relatively unknown. This paper reports findings from an analysis of various use cases of big data in cities worldwide and the authors' four projects with government organizations toward developing smart cities. Specifically, this paper classifies the urban data use cases into four reference models and identifies six challenges in transforming data into information for smart cities. Furthermore, building upon the relevant literature, this paper proposes five considerations for addressing the challenges in implementing the reference models in real-world applications. The reference models, challenges, and considerations collectively form a framework for data use for smart cities.

The net inflow of population showed a diamond shaped with cross frame support in each period, the four nodes of the diamond contain Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xi'an. Main mobility assembling centers are distributed in the urban agglomerations of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Chengdu-Chongqing, and those centers have strong coherence with those urban hierarchies. Most cities are in a state of {\textquotedblleft}relative equilibrium{\textquotedblright} in the population flow, and clear hierarchical structure and level distinction can be identified. Spatial patterns of population mobility present obvious core-periphery structures. The Dali-Hegang line exhibits a significant network of spatial differences in terms of boundary divisions.

We apply recent advances in network science to conduct a more refined analysis of U.S. commuting patterns, and examine their effects on local economic growth. Results show that network degree and entropy measures explain variations in county per capita income growth patterns. Higher in- and out-commuting entropies are associated with lower per capita income growth, but their interaction enhances economic growth in places simultaneously open to both in- and out-commuters. Using these results, common ground may be found for creating new forms of regional governance that better reflect local realities of cross-county border flows of workers and economic activity.},

	abstract = {The analysis of the structure and evolution of complex networks has recently received considerable attention. Although research on networks originated in mathematical studies dating back to the nineteenth century (or earlier), and developed further in the mid-twentieth century with contributions to graph theory, interest in its application to the social sciences is currently growing---particularly in regional science and transportation, because of the spatial relevance of networks. This paper presents a dynamic outlook for the German commuting network from the perspective of the German labor market districts. The focus of this paper is to explore how the German commuting network evolves, from two perspectives: space and connectivity. We consider home-to-work commuters moving between 439 German districts for the years 1995 and 2005. The results of the present analysis make it possible to identify, among the main German districts, the most {\textquotedblleft}open{\textquotedblright} and connected ones. These emerging districts can be considered as potential {\textquotedblleft}hubs{\textquotedblright} in the German commuting system---that is, as attractors from the perspective of spatial economics, and as interconnectors from the perspective of networking.},

	abstract = {While it is well known that ignoring spatial dependence often results in misspecification of models, travel demand models almost never account for this phenomenon. The aim of this paper is to empirically demonstrate the importance of accounting for potential spatial dependence between observations in the specification of spatial interaction models. As a case study, we analyze travel flows on the public transport system in an urban region in the Netherlands. We develop five distinct spatial interaction models (SIMs) of increasing complexity, each encompassing a lower and upper level model. At the lower level, the attractiveness of neighborhoods for boarding and alighting is modeled based on spatial and transit supply characteristics. At the upper level, spatial interactions among zones are modeled taking into account competing origins, competing destinations as well as network characteristics. We systematically compare more traditional SIM formulations with a SIM that explicitly accounts for spatial and network autocorrelation. The results show a substantial difference between the former models and the latter, in terms of the estimated total marginal impacts of the different variables and the pattern of the error terms. The results of our study underscore that the failure to incorporate autocorrelation effects in travel models is likely to influence model outcomes, which in turn may have profound implications for the very design of public transport networks in cities and regions.},

There are many studies that have focused on these effects and studied the impacts of ICT on urban elements and functions. The results of most of these studies are based on arguments about the impacts of these technologies on decentralization or centralization trends in urban spatial structure. In this study, we attempt to categorize the findings of the related studies through a literature review. Although ICT includes conventional communication media such as radio, television, and landlines, here we only focused on new technologies, especially the Internet and mobile phone. For this aim, related studies were searched using wide range of keywords in four scientific information databases for researches published in English and the search period was limited according to the nature of the subject from 1990 to 2017. Subsequently, with the study of the abstracts and the findings of the studies, at last, 80 articles related to the topic were selected for literature review. The result of this review showed that theoretical viewpoints on spatial effects of ICT on urban spatial structure can be categorized into four approaches: A) centralization effects; B) decentralization effects; C) dual effects (both centralization and decentralization); and D) low impact or no effects. The results also indicate that most studies have been focused on the decentralization (42\%) and dual effects (33\%) impacts, some emphasize on centralization effects (16\%), and few studies have also concluded that ICT does not have any effect on the spatial structure of cities or its effects are negligible (9\%). Generally, it can be concluded that majority of scholars have consensus that ICT can affect urban spatial structure; what is controversial is only the way of these effects and consequences. Therefore, a proper understanding of the relationship between ICT and the urban spatial structure is essential for urban planners, professionals, researchers and managers.},

By using a uniformly most powerful unbiased (UMPU) test between the lognormal and the power-laws, we show that conclusive results can be achieved to end this debate. We advocate the UMPU test as a systematic tool to address similar controversies in the literature of many disciplines involving power laws, scaling, "fat" or "heavy" tails. In order to demonstrate that our procedure works for data sets other than the US city size distribution, we also briefly present the results obtained for the power-law tail of the distribution of personal identity (ID) losses, which constitute one of the major emergent risks at the interface between cyberspace and reality.},

We show that increasing the degree of cooperativity induces a qualitative transition from a segregated phase of low utility toward a mixed phase of high utility.

The classical theory for job search is based on the idea that workers evaluate the wage of potential jobs as they arrive sequentially through time, and extending this model with space, we obtain predictions that are strongly contradicted by our empirical findings. We propose an alternative model that is based on the idea that workers evaluate potential jobs based on a quality aspect and that workers search for jobs sequentially across space. We also assume that the density of potential jobs depends on the skills of the worker and decreases with the wage. The predicted distribution of commuting distances decays as 1/r3 and is independent of the distribution of the quality of jobs. We find our alternative model to be in agreement with our data. This type of approach opens new perspectives for the modelling of mobility.},

	abstract = {Trip distribution laws are basic for the travel demand characterization needed in transport and urban planning. Several approaches have been considered in the last years. One of them is the so-called gravity law, in which the number of trips is assumed to be related to the population at origin and destination and to decrease with the distance. The mathematical expression of this law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another popular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which argues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only the role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between them. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two approaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them against empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different countries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities laws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the probability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called trip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the commuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We show that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities laws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network and to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting commuting flows at large distances. Finally, we show that the different approaches can be used in the absence of detailed data for calibration since their only parameter depends only on the scale of the geographic unit.},

Recently, attempts to formalize mathematically these expectations have led to the hypothesis of urban scaling, namely that certain properties of all cities change, on average, with their size in predictable scale-invariant ways. The emergence of these scaling relations depends on a few general properties of cities as social networks, co-located in space and time, that conceivably apply to a wide range of human settlements. Here, we discuss the present evidence for the hypothesis of urban scaling, some of the methodological issues dealing with proxy measurements and units of analysis and place these findings in the context of other theories of cities and urban systems. We show that a large body of evidence about the scaling properties of cities indicates, in analogy to other complex systems, that they cannot be treated as extensive systems and discuss the consequences of these results for an emerging statistical theory of cities.},

In this paper, we map society-wide communication networks to the urban areas of two European countries. We show that both the total number of contacts and the total communication activity grow superlinearly with city population size, according to well-defined scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase that affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability that an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains largely unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and scale-invariant acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as cities get bigger, which is numerically confirmed by applying epidemiological models to the studied networks. Our findings should provide a microscopic basis towards understanding the superlinear increase of different socioeconomic quantities with city size, that applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for instance, the creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain contagious diseases.},

	abstract = {Scaling has been proposed as a powerful tool to analyze the properties of complex systems and in particular for cities where it describes how various properties change with population. The empirical study of scaling on a wide range of urban datasets displays apparent nonlinear behaviors whose statistical validity and meaning were recently the focus of many debates. We discuss here another aspect, which is the implication of such scaling forms on individual cities and how they can be used for predicting the behavior of a city when its population changes. We illustrate this discussion in the case of delay due to traffic congestion with a dataset of 101 US cities in the years 1982{\textendash}2014. We show that the scaling form obtained by agglomerating all of the available data for different cities and for different years does display a nonlinear behavior, but which appears to be unrelated to the dynamics of individual cities when their population grows. In other words, the congestion-induced delay in a given city does not depend on its population only, but also on its previous history. This strong path dependency prohibits the existence of a simple scaling form valid for all cities and shows that we cannot always agglomerate the data for many different systems. More generally, these results also challenge the use of transversal data for understanding longitudinal series for cities.},

Both empirical observations and theoretical approaches are critically reviewed, with particular emphasis placed on derivations of classical models and results, along with analysis of their limits and validity. Key aspects of cities are thoroughly analyzed, including mobility patterns, the impact of multimodality, the coupling between different transportation modes, the evolution of infrastructure networks, spatial and social organisation, and interactions between cities. Drawing upon knowledge and methods from areas of mathematics, physics, economics and geography, the resulting quantitative description of cities will be of interest to all those studying and researching how to model these complex systems.},

To address this issue, we propose and implement a novel architecture mPat to explore human mobility using multi-source urban network data. A reference implementation of mPat was developed at an unprecedented scale upon the urban infrastructures of Shenzhen, China. The novelty and uniqueness of mPat lie in its three layers: 1) a data feed layer consisting of real-time data feeds from various urban networks with 24 thousand vehicles, 16 million smart cards, and 10 million cellphones; 2) a mobility abstraction layer exploring correlation and divergence among multi-source data to infer human mobility with a context-aware optimization model based on block coordinate decent; and 3) an application layer to improve urban efficiency based on the human mobility findings of the study. The evaluation shows that mPat achieves a 79\% inference accuracy, and that its real-world application reduces passenger travel time by 36\%.},

Based on their power-law characteristics, we derive analytical models for the spatial node density and mobility degree and show that the data generated by the proposed analytical models closely approach the empirical data extracted from the real mobility traces. Another contribution of our work is to use the proposed analytical models to build a synthetic mobility regime that is suitable for simulations of intelligent transportation systems.

The studies of human mobility modeling and prediction play a vital role in a series of applications such as urban planning, epidemic control, location-based services, and intelligent transportation management. In this survey, we review human mobility models based on a human-centric angle in a datadriven context. Specifically, we characterize human mobility patterns from individual, collective, and hybrid levels. Meanwhile, we survey human mobility prediction methods from four aspects and then describe recent development respectively. Finally, we discuss some open issues that provide a helpful reference for researchers' future direction.

Network clustering methods are applied to those networks for extracting community structures of cities. Although many studies have attempted to extract community structures of cities using human mobility data and network clustering methods, little has been explored about which method is the most effective, in terms of the accuracy and the amount of information of extracted clusters. In this paper, we propose evaluation metrics for evaluating network clustering methods based on the geographical cohesiveness, the regularity, and the amount of information of extracted clusters. We use smart card data of public transportation collected in Japan for testing the effectiveness of each method. We compare two types of origin-destination matrices for constructing networks and four types of network clustering methods including two types of bipartite network clustering methods. The results confirmed that a bipartite network clustering method considering multi-facet characteristics of each cluster and the functional relations between areas of a city shows the most accurate and richest information about community structures of cities.},

The origin-destination (OD) datasets generated by human daily travel behavior reflect urban dynamics. Previous spatio-temporal analysis methods utilize these datasets to extract popular city areas, with the ignorance of the flow relationships between areas. Several methods have been unable to determine time steps with similar spatial characteristics automatically or failed to recognize the evolutionary patterns of various modalities for a city. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to discover the hidden semantic-level city dynamics from OD data. The method carries out spatial simplification and constructs a sequence of location networks at first. Then, the hourly network is studied as a document consisting of trip relationships among location clusters, enabling a semantic analysis of the OD dataset as a document corpus. Hidden themes, namely, traffic topics, are identified through a topic modeling technique in an unsupervised manner. Finally, an interactive visual analytics system is designed to intuitively demonstrate the probability-based thematic information and the evolutionary activity patterns of a city. The feasibility and validity of our method are demonstrated via case studies with two kinds of real-world datasets: bike-sharing system (BSS) dataset and taxi dataset. Semantic-level city structures and recurrent behaviors representing the life of a large set of users, as well as the differences in BSS usage patterns of two cities are discovered. We also discover how people use different means of transportation for one city.},

Therefore, it is of great value to propose a new urban subcenter identification method that can overcome these shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce an alternative method. Unlike two-stage procedures and other arbitrary methods, our method is not based on arbitrary cutoff values and is entirely parameter free. We first calculate the commuting fluxes for each pair of census tracts and use the fluxes to represent a local density. After that, the census tracts are partitioned into several clusters using a clustering algorithm. Finally, subcenters are derived from the clusters through a circularly shaped spatial scan statistic. We apply this method to 2010 and 2015 census data sets for Wuhan, China. The identification and comparison results demonstrate that our proposed method is effective and can be applied toward future research.},

	abstract = {Sparse mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a promising paradigm for the large-scale urban sensing, which allows us to collect data from only a few areas (cell selection) and infer the data of other areas (data inference). It can significantly reduce the sensing cost while ensuring high data quality. Recently, large urban sensing systems often require multiple types of sensing data (e.g., publish two tasks on temperature and humidity respectively) to form a multi-dimensional urban sensing map. These multiple types of sensing data hold some inherent correlations, which can be leveraged to further reduce the sensing cost and improve the accuracy of the inferred results. In this paper, we study the multi-dimensional urban sensing in sparse MCS to jointly address the data inference and cell selection for multi-task scenarios. We exploit the intra- and inter-task correlations in data inference to deduce the data of the unsensed cells through the multi-task compressive sensing and then learn and select the most effective \${\textbackslash}langle \$ cell, task \${\textbackslash}rangle \$ pairs by using reinforcement learning. To effectively capture the intra- and inter-task correlations in cell selection, we design a network structure with multiple branches, where branches extract the intra-task correlations for each task, respectively, and then catenates the results from all branches to capture the inter-task correlations among the multiple tasks. In addition, we present a two-stage online framework for reinforcement learning in practical use, including training and running phases. The extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world urban sensing datasets, each with two types of sensing data, which verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms on multi-dimensional urban sensing and achieve better performances than the state-of-the-art mechanisms.},

In this study, we present our initial work on applying deep generative models to urban street network data to create spatially explicit urban models. We based our work on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) which are deep generative models that have recently gained their popularity due to the ability to generate realistic images. Initial results show that VAEs are capable of capturing key high-level urban network metrics using low-dimensional vectors and generating new urban forms of complexity matching the cities captured in the street network data.},

The description should help formulate planning questions about the development of urban networks. This paper proposes three different views: node-, density- and accessibility-based. Urban networks can morphologically be described as major nodes or concentrations of activities and physical and/or functional connections between nodes in a geographical area. Beyond this morphological description, places within an area can also be characterised by the amount and diversity of activities to be accessed by means of a transport network. This paper will compare these different views of the urban network for the northern part of the Randstad Holland conurbation (the greater Amsterdam area) by means of different spatial representations. The comparisons between the patterns of these representations can help explore the changing urban network, giving rise to planning questions, which can help formulate a planning research agenda for urban networks.},

	abstract = {Should China build mega-cities or a network of linked middle-sized metropolises? Can Europe{\textquoteright}s mid-sized cities compete with global agglomeration by forging stronger inter-urban links? This paper examines these questions within a model of recombinant growth and endogenous local amenities. Three primary factors determine the trade-off between networks and big cities: local returns to scale in innovation, the elasticity of housing supply, and the importance of local amenities. Even if there are global increasing returns, the returns to local scale in innovation may be decreasing, and that makes networks more appealing than mega-cities. Inelastic housing supply makes it harder to supply more space in dense confines, which perhaps explains why networks are more popular in regulated Europe than in the American Sunbelt. Larger cities can dominate networks because of amenities, as long as the benefits of scale overwhelm the downsides of density. In our framework, the skilled are more likely to prefer mega-cities than the less skilled, and the long-run benefits of either mega-cities or networks may be quite different from the short-run benefits.},

However, the traditional methods used to study the travel behavior of the passengers inside the city are time and labor consuming. The records of the cellular communication provide a potential huge data source for this study to follow the movement of passengers. This study focuses on the passengers{\textquoteright} travel behavior of the Hongqiao transportation hub in Shanghai, China, utilizing the mobile phone data. First, a systematic and novel method is presented to extract the trip information from the mobile phone data. Several key travel characteristics of passengers, including passengers traveling inside the city and between cities, are analyzed and compared. The results show that the proposed method is effective to obtain the travel trajectories of mobile phone users. Besides, the travel behavior of incity passengers and external passengers are quite different. Then, the correlation analysis of the passengers{\textquoteright} travel trajectories is provided to research the availability of the comprehensive area. Moreover, the results of the correlation analysis further indicate that the comprehensive area of the Hongqiao hub plays a relatively important role in passengers{\textquoteright} daily travel.},

Our results show that the urban indicator scales superlinearly with the population, namely, Y(N)?N$\beta$ with $\beta${\textgreater}1, if Y(N) represents a creative productivity and the indicator scales sublinearly ($\beta${\textless}1) if Y(N) is related to the degree of infrastructure development.

These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

	abstract = {Residential locations, the jobs{\textendash}housing relationship, and commuting patterns are key elements to understand urban spatial structure and how city dwellers live. Their successive interaction is important for various fields including urban planning, transport, intraurban migration studies, and social science. However, understanding of the long-term trajectories of workplace and home location, and the resulting commuting patterns, is still limited due to lack of year-to-year data tracking individual behavior. With a 7-y transit smartcard dataset, this paper traces individual trajectories of residences and workplaces. Based on in-metro travel times before and after job and/or home moves, we find that 45 min is an inflection point where the behavioral preference changes. Commuters whose travel time exceeds the point prefer to shorten commutes via moves, while others with shorter commutes tend to increase travel time for better jobs and/or residences. Moreover, we capture four mobility groups: home mover, job hopper, job-and-residence switcher, and stayer. This paper studies how these groups trade off travel time and housing expenditure with their job and housing patterns. Stayers with high job and housing stability tend to be home (apartment unit) owners subject to middle- to high-income groups. Home movers work at places similar to stayers, while they may upgrade from tenancy to ownership. Switchers increase commute time as well as housing expenditure via job and home moves, as they pay for better residences and work farther from home. Job hoppers mainly reside in the suburbs, suffer from long commutes, change jobs frequently, and are likely to be low-income migrants.},

	abstract = {The rapid growth of internet based ride-sharing brings great changes to residents' travel and city traffic. However, few studies had employed empirical data to examine the unique travel patterns of internet based ride-sharing trips. In this paper, we compare taxi trip records and internet based ride-sharing trip records provided by DiDi company. Results reveal many interesting findings that had never been reported before. From the viewpoint of service patterns, ride-sharing mainly increases supplies in hot areas and peak hours. By applying a non-negative matrix factorization method, we find that ride-sharing principally serves as an approach for commuting. So, as an effective supplement to traditional taxi service, it regulates spatial and temporal supply-demand imbalance, especially during morning and evening rush periods. From the viewpoint of individual behavior patterns, we use a clustering method to identify two kinds of internet based ride-sharing drivers. The first kind of drivers usually provides ride-sharing along daily home-work commuting. Trips served by these drivers have relatively constant origin-designation (OD) pairs. The second kind of drivers does not serve regularly and roams around the city even in working hours. Therefore, there are no constant OD pairs in their ride-sharing trips. Counterintuitively, we find that home-work commuting drivers account for only a small part of total drivers and they only serve a small number of commuting trips. In addition, internet based ride-sharing is not just traditional hitchhiking worked through mobile internet. We find that internet based ride-sharing drivers intend to make long distance trips, and they intend to detour further to pick up or drop off passengers than traditional hitchhike drivers since they are paid. All these findings are helpful for policy makers at all levels to make informed decisions about deployment of internet based ride-sharing service. This paper also verifies that big data analytics is particularly useful and powerful in the analysis of ride-sharing and taxi service patterns.},

Few studies explore how people organize their daily travels and which behavioral principles result in the choices of specific network types.

The results suggest that 99.9\% of people{\textquoteright}s travels can be characterized by a limited set of location-based motifs and activity-based motifs. The results further reveal that the least effort principle governs the preferred motif choices through quantifying the rank-frequency properties. The scaling properties of distance characteristically impact motifs, and their scaling differences by node numbers and motif types coincide with the popularities of motifs, verifying the self-adaptions in motif choices; that is, although individuals travel with unique propensities, they always tend to choose the motif with the lowest consumption that satisfies their demand.},

Site factors were not related to personal characteristics, but age and group size were culturally different. Activities and spatial occupancies differed between unaccompanied and accompanied users. Compared to single users, users in groups tended to participate in multiple activities at once, and their activities included more interactions. Single users' spatial distributions conformed to the edge effect, but users in groups were evenly distributed in the spaces. Three types of social relationships were defined: Intimate Pair, Intimate Group and Social Group. Intimate Pairs were most likely to use mobile phones and use private spaces, Intimate Groups were most likely to be talking and sitting and to use park amenities, and Social Groups were most likely to be playing games and relaxing in spacious open areas. Regarding spatial occupancy, Intimate Pairs and Social Groups were most likely to use the middle and peripheral regions, and the Intimate Groups tended to be evenly distributed in the spaces. The results of this study stress the importance of designing public spaces for the types of users expected to use the spaces and to consider various types of social relationship groups.},

The research applied data from location check-in, transit smart card, taxi trajectory, and residential travel survey. We developed four types of measures to evaluate the effectives of UGBs in confining human activities and travel flows, to examine the conformity of urban activities with the planned population, and to measure the activity connections between UGBs. With the large proportions of intra- and inter-boundary travel flows and an overwhelming majority of check-ins inside the UGBs, the research concluded that Beijing{\textquoteright}s UGBs were effective in containing human mobility and activity. However, the connections between UGBs, indicated by the spatial differentiation of the travel flows, were not consistent with the plan{\textquoteright}s intention and strategy. It indicated the potential underdevelopment of the public transit serving several new cities.},

	abstract = {Although researchers have realised the importance of time for decades in geography and relevant disciplines, they more or less ignore how our understanding can be greatly enriched through the lens of time. One outcome of this ignorance is that there are a limited number of concepts and methods to analyse the temporal pattern of human activities. In this paper, we try to understand the temporal pattern of activities by simultaneously examining the start and end time of activities, rather than from a conventional view, which usually understands a temporal pattern of activities as a profile of an attribute (e.g. the number of activities) on the time axis. To achieve this, we propose a new concept, Temporal Areas of Interest (TAI), defined as the area on a two-dimensional plane using the start and end time as the X and Y axes, where activity points are densely distributed and therefore attracts people's attention/interest. We also propose a general methodological framework for identifying TAIs. The concept and framework are applied using a week's metro smart card data in Shanghai. Results show both the basic rhythm of human activities and reveal some facts that are unexpected or ignored before, such as the large existence of overtime work or similar activities on weekday evenings and weekends. We think that the proposed method provides an alternative way to understand the temporal pattern of activities and a relatively new perspective in evaluating human activity patterns and the urban functions across the city.},

	abstract = {Where we live affects all aspects of our life and thus our happiness. In recent years, and now for more than half of the population of the Earth, our place of residence or activity has been increasingly transformed into an urban one. However, while the impact of happiness studies has grown in importance during the last twenty years, we note that happiness-related concepts find it difficult to penetrate the planning and design of cities, and affect the field of urban studies. In this paper, we map the temporal evolution of the fields of happiness and urban studies into dynamic networks obtained by paper keywords co-occurrence analysis. We identify the main concepts of the {\textquotedblleft}urban happiness{\textquotedblright} field and their capacity to agglomerate into coherent thematic clusters. We find that while quality of life and well-being are highly interconnected with some well-defined urban categories, other happinessrelated concepts, as subjective well-being or happiness itself, are located in peripheral positions where their influence is minimised. We present a one-parameter spatial network model in order to reproduce the changes in the topology of these networks. Results explain the evolution and the level of interpenetration of these two fields as a function of {\textquotedblleft}conceptual{\textquotedblright} distances, mapped into Euclidean ones. In addition to other approaches (i.e., cofrequency matrix of bibliometric analysis), complex networks science appears as a valid alternative and opens the way for the systematic study of other academic fields in terms of complex evolving networks.},

	abstract = {Smartphones present new forms of spatiality and sociality for cities worldwide. The sudden outburst in smartphone technologies has revolutionised human relations creating new possibilities of encounter and connectivity. This paper examines people's smartphone usage patterns and highlights how this is increasing human vulnerabilities in cities with resultant wider societal implications. Drawing on the theory of vulnerability, Hofstede's cultural dimension theory and carrying out semi-structured interviews in the United Kingdom and Ghana, the paper reveals that the current scale of usage and addiction to smartphones and social media are fostering emerging forms of everyday vulnerabilities. Victimisation, privacy breach, home emergencies and road accidents are prevalent vulnerabilities in both Accra and London. By comparing participants' smartphone usage patterns and their motives for adopting or ignoring certain social media practices, the study illustrates how the concept of attitudinal vulnerability extends our understanding of Hofstede's theory of collectivism and individualism. While the finding from Accra complicates Hofstede's collectivism label as there seems to be a loss of genuine sense of care and people-centeredness among participants it confirms individualism tendencies among the participants in London though some tendencies of {\textquoteleft}virtual collectivism{\textquoteright} were observed. In conclusion, the study emphasises how significant behavioural changes among smartphone users can reduce human-induced vulnerabilities in cities. By so doing, we add weight to the literature that focuses on the importance of developing context-specific cuttingedge ICT policies vis-{\`a}-vis building smart, safe and sustainable cities.},

When analysing temporal pattern of a group of activities, most researchers tend to utilise one temporal attribute when representing time use of activities. Thus, temporal pattern of activities is usually visualised and understood as a profile of various observations listed sequentially over time. This paper aims to investigate the temporal pattern of activities in urban areas from a new perspective. Temporal pattern is visualised and analysed as the distribution of activity points in a two-dimensional temporal plane defined by the start and end time of activities as x and y axes. Kernel density estimation is used as a typical method to observe the temporal pattern of activities in Shanghai based on a oneweek smart card dataset generated in the Shanghai's metro system. The results show that the proposed perspective can reveal considerably more information regarding the temporal pattern than a conventional one can.},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatial networks formed by the trajectories of mobile users can be beneficial to applications ranging from epidemiology to local search. Despite the potential for impact in a number of fields, several aspects of human mobility networks remain largely unexplored due to the lack of large-scale data at a fine spatiotemporal resolution. Using a longitudinal dataset from the location-based service Foursquare, we perform an empirical analysis of the topological properties of place networks and note their resemblance to online social networks in terms of heavy-tailed degree distributions, triadic closure mechanisms and the small world property. Unlike social networks however, place networks present a mixture of connectivity trends in terms of assortativity that are surprisingly similar to those of the web graph. We take advantage of additional semantic information to interpret how nodes that take on functional roles such as {\textquoteleft}travel hub{\textquoteright}, or {\textquoteleft}food spot{\textquoteright} behave in these networks. Finally, motivated by the large volume of new links appearing in place networks over time, we formulate the classic link prediction problem in this new domain. We propose a novel variant of gravity models that brings together three essential elements of inter-place connectivity in urban environments: network-level interactions, human mobility dynamics, and geographic distance. We evaluate this model and find it outperforms a number of baseline predictors and supervised learning algorithms on a task of predicting new links in a sample of one hundred popular cities.},

In this work, we present a novel network perspective on the interconnected nature of people and places, allowing us to capture the social diversity of urban locations through the social network and mobility patterns of their visitors. We use a dataset of approximately 37K users and 42K venues in London to build a network of Foursquare places and the parallel Twitter social network of visitors through check-ins. We define four metrics of the social diversity of places which relate to their social brokerage role, their entropy, the homogeneity of their visitors and the amount of serendipitous encounters they are able to induce. This allows us to distinguish between places that bring together strangers versus those which tend to bring together friends, as well as places that attract diverse individuals as opposed to those which attract regulars. We correlate these properties with wellbeing indicators for London neighbourhoods and discover signals of gentrification in deprived areas with high entropy and brokerage, where an influx of more affluent and diverse visitors points to an overall improvement of their rank according to the UK Index of Multiple Deprivation for the area over the five-year census period. Our analysis sheds light on the relationship between the prosperity of people and places, distinguishing between different categories and urban geographies of consequence to the development of urban policy and the next generation of socially-aware location-based applications.},

It can also lead to deep understandings of human mobility and help characterize city locations and their connectivity. In this paper, we construct location networks for six cities using a large-scale Instagram dataset. We find that these location networks share many topological features as in other different types of networks, along with properties specific to their cities. By mapping locations to their geographical coordinates, we further show that (1) our construction method can effectively reveal popular city locations, and (2) for two locations there is no clear correlation between their network distance and geographical distance. Moreover, all six location networks contain three or four large communities covering almost all locations in a city and the large communities in each city often exhibit clear spatial differences in geographical space.},

	abstract = {Recently, some studies have shown that human movement patterns are strongly associated with regional socioeconomic indicators such as per capita income and poverty rate. These studies, however, are limited in numbers and they have not reached a consensus on what indicators or how effectively they can possibly be used to reflect the socioeconomic characteristics of the underlying populations. In this study, we propose an analytical framework {\textemdash} by coupling large scale mobile phone and urban socioeconomic datasets {\textemdash} to better understand human mobility patterns and their relationships with travelers' socioeconomic status (SES). Six mobility indicators, which include radius of gyration, number of activity locations, activity entropy, travel diversity, k-radius of gyration, and unicity, are derived to quantify important aspects of mobile phone users' mobility characteristics. A data fusion approach is proposed to approximate, at an aggregate level, the SES of mobile phone users. Using Singapore and Boston as case studies, we compare the statistical properties of the six mobility indicators in the two cities and analyze how they vary across socioeconomic classes. The results provide a multifaceted view of the relationships between mobility and SES. Specifically, it is found that phone user groups that are generally richer tend to travel shorter in Singapore but longer in Boston. One of the potential reasons, as suggested by our analysis, is that the rich neighborhoods in the two cities are respectively central and peripheral. For three other mobility indicators that reflect the diversity of individual travel and activity patterns (i.e., number of activity locations, activity entropy, and travel diversity), we find that for both cities, phone users across different socioeconomic classes exhibit very similar characteristics. This indicates that wealth level, at least in Singapore and Boston, is not a factor that restricts how people travel around in the city. In sum, our comparative analysis suggests that the relationship between mobility and SES could vary among cities, and such relationship is influenced by the spatial arrangement of housing, employment opportunities, and human activities.},

In other words, the goal-directed nature of human movement has little effect on the overall traffic distribution. We further simulate the mobility of a large number of random walkers and find that (1) the simulated random walkers can reproduce the same human mobility pattern, and (2) the simulated mobility rate of the random walkers correlates pretty well (an R square up to 0.87) with the observed human mobility rate.},

However, limited efforts have been made to reveal the spatial variations of multi-modal public ridership (such as buses, metro systems, and taxis) and the underlying controlling factors. This study explores multi-modal public ridership and compares the similarities and differences of the associated factors. Daily bus, metro, and taxi ridership patterns are first extracted from multiple sources of big transportation data, including vehicle (bus and taxi) GPS trajectories and smart card data. Multivariate regression analysis and geographically weighted regression analysis are used to reveal the associations between these data and demographic, land use, and transportation factors. An empirical study in Shenzhen, China, suggests that employment, mixed land use, and road density have significant effects on the ridership of each mode; however, some effects vary from negative to positive across the city. The results also indicate that road density, income, and metro accessibility do not have significant effects on metro, transit or bus ridership. These findings suggest that the effects of the associated factors vary depending on the mode of travel being considered and that the city should carefully consider which factors to emphasize in formulating future transport policy.},

This has been done at different spatial scales using different datasets, and several versions of the models have been proposed to adjust to various spatial systems. However, the models, to our knowledge, have never been compared with respect to policy testing scenarios. For this reason, here we use the models to analyse the impact of the introduction of a new transportation network, a bus rapid transport system, in the city of Teresina in Brazil. We do this by measuring the estimated variation in the trip distribution, and formulate an accessibility to employment indicator for the different zones of the city. By comparing the results obtained with the two approaches, we are able to not only better assess the goodness of fit and the impact of this intervention, but also understand reasons for the systematic similarities and differences in their predictions.},

We use Thiessen polygons (termed {\textquoteleft}cells{\textquoteright}) as the unit of analysis to approximate the service area of each mobile base tower. Major findings encompass the following three aspects. First, cells with high betweenness centrality are linearly distributed in space, which closely aligns with major transportation corridors. We find that this pattern can be explained by analysing the characteristics of calling activities on transportation networks. Second, we detect a two-level hierarchy of communities that correspond well to county and prefecture-level administrative unit boundaries. Lastly, almost every community identified at the two hierarchical levels contains a cell with high betweenness. These cells are located near the political and economic centres and play the role of hubs in the regional socio-economic system. This research demonstrates that networks built from mobile phone data provide new understandings of spatial interactions and regional structures.},

	abstract = {This article provides a novel and practical approach for investigating the characteristics of intercity telecommunication network whose overall and complete information is unavailable. Using a mobile phone call data set covering 4.39 million subscribers registered in a particular region, we construct two intercity mobile communication subnets and infer characteristics of the whole intercity mobile communication network of China. Results confirm that intercity communication intensity is characterized by the gravity model. The communication intensity based on mobile call number decreases along the distance with a scaling exponent 0.5, whereas the scaling exponent for the communication intensity based on mobile call duration is 0.4. Moreover, we uncover the rank-size distribution of tie strength (mobile call number and duration) between a city and its neighbours. The rank-size law of tie strengths between cities is mainly determined by the rank-size distribution of cities. The distance between cities plays a less decisive role than the size distribution in the network, but significantly impacts mobile communication patterns. The call duration of individual intercity mobile communication is generally positively correlated to the communication distance, explaining why the distance decay of communication intensity based on call durations is slower than that based on call numbers. The contribution of this research is twofold. First, we identify the distance decay effect in intercity mobile communications of China and uncover the dominant impact of the rank-size distribution of cities. Second, a method for estimating the properties of the whole network according to the observed interactions of its subnets is developed.},

	abstract = {Mixed use has been extensively applied as an urban planning principle and hinders the study of single urban functions. To address this problem, it is worth decomposing the mixed use. Inspired by the concept of spectral unmixing in remote sensing applications, this paper proposes a framework for mixed-use decomposition based on big geo-data. Mixed-use decomposition in terms of human activities differs from traditional land use research, and it is more reasonable to infer the actual urban function of land. The framework consists of four steps, namely temporal activity signature extraction, urban function base curve extraction, mixed-use decomposition, and result validation. First, the temporal activity signatures (TASs) of each zone are extracted as the proxy of human activity patterns. Second, the diurnal TASs of routine activities are extracted as urban function base curves (i.e. endmembers). Third, a linear decomposition model is used to decompose the mixed use and obtain multiple results (urban function composition, dynamic activity proportions, and the mixing index). Finally, result validation strategies are concluded. This framework offers method extensibility and has few requirements for the input data. It is validated by means of a case study of Beijing, based on a social media check-in dataset.},

	abstract = {Regions are subdivisions of the earth{\textquoteright}s surface, and many systems of regionalization were proposed. Recently, with the availability of geotagged data, it raises the question of whether regions formed by human interactions agree with government districts. Thus, using network partitioning method with spatial constraint, we derive regional delineations at different spatial scales and examine their agreement with administrative districts. Experiments were conducted using the social media data of Shenzhen, China. Aggregately, the results show that the derived regions become inconsistent with administrative districts by increasing the spatial effect value, which can be largely attributed to the involvement of long human movements. However, the regions tend to keep stable when more long edges are included, which suggests the limitation of long movements effect. Individually, most northern administrative districts display high inconsistency with the derived regions, whereas most southern districts show high consistency. Besides, regions far from the downtown are less connected to the rest of the city, regions near the downtown are more connected, and particularly, regions in Nanshan, Futian, and Luohu are highly connected with each other, which form the backbone of total flows irrespective of spatial effect value. The results were finally validated at specific areas and compared with those using other methods, another dataset, and different spatial units, which suggest the feasibility of our regions for decision making in urban planning and management.},

	abstract = {Our knowledge of how cities bring together different social classes is still limited. Much effort has been devoted to investigating residential segregation, mostly over well-defined social groups (e.g., race). Little is known of how mobility and human communications affect urban social integration. The dynamics of spatial and social-network segregation and individual variations along these two dimensions are largely untapped. In this article, we put forward a computational framework based on coupling large-scale information on human mobility, social network connections, and people{\textquoteright}s socioeconomic status (SES), to provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the dynamics of spatiotemporal and social-network segregation in cities. Building on top of a social similarity measure, the framework can be used to depict segregation dynamics down to the individual level, and meanwhile, provide aggregate measurements at the scale of places and cities, and their evolution over time. By applying the methodology in Singapore using large-scale mobile phone and socioeconomic datasets, we find a relatively higher level of segregation among relatively wealthier classes, a finding that holds for both social and physical space. We also highlight the interplay between the effect of distance decay and homophily as forces that determine communication intensity, defining a notion of characteristic {\textquotedblleft}homophily distance{\textquotedblright} that can be used to measure social segregation across cities. The time-resolved analysis reveals the changing landscape of urban segregation and time-varying roles of places. Segregations in physical and social space are weakly correlated at the individual level, but highly correlated when grouped across at least hundreds of individuals. The methodology and analysis presented in this paper enable a deeper understanding of the dynamics of human segregation in social and physical space, which can assist social scientists, planners, and city authorities in the design of more integrated cities.},

	abstract = {This book presents the features and advantages offered by complex networks in the machine learning domain. In the first part, an overview on complex networks and network-based machine learning is presented, offering necessary background material. In the second part, we describe in details some specific techniques based on complex networks for supervised, non-supervised, and semi-supervised learning. Particularly, a stochastic particle competition technique for both non-supervised and semi-supervised learning using a stochastic nonlinear dynamical system is described in details. Moreover, an analytical analysis is supplied, which enables one to predict the behavior of the proposed technique. In addition, data reliability issues are explored in semi-supervised learning. Such matter has practical importance and is not often found in the literature. With the goal of validating these techniques for solving real problems, simulations on broadly accepted databases are conducted. Still in this book, we present a hybrid supervised classification technique that combines both low and high orders of learning. The low level term can be implemented by any classification technique, while the high level term is realized by the extraction of features of the underlying network constructed from the input data. Thus, the former classifies the test instances by their physical features, while the latter measures the compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the data. We show that the high level technique can realize classification according to the semantic meaning of the data. This book intends to combine two widely studied research areas, machine learning and complex networks, which in turn will generate broad interests to scientific community, mainly to computer science and engineering areas.},

While previous research has focused solely on measuring the spatial arrangement of restricted urban landscape elements using spatial metrics, to date, the detailed landscape characteristics that enable different functions to be distinguished have not been discussed. This paper presents a novel framework for urban function classification by measuring urban landscapes using spatial metrics. To capture features related to urban functions rather than measuring limited physical configurations, spatial metrics that quantify multiple urban landscape elements and their interactions are proposed. Then, these metrics are evaluated based on their sufficiency and effectiveness in classifying urban functions using a partial analysis and analysis of variance. Finally, a conditional inference random forest approach is proposed to build an automatic urban function classification model with spatial metrics. The model was implemented in Futian District, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. Using 8 spatial metrics based on 6 types of urban landscape elements, the results show a satisfactory testing accuracy of 0.757 and an overall classification accuracy of 0.813. The proposed method provides a novel framework for effectively delineating urban landscape characteristics and accurately classifying urban functions.},

	abstract = {The relationship between location and land use patterns is one of the classic theoretical issues in urban studies. Classic models based on the monocentricity hypothesis have limitations in the interpretation of modern urban structure. China has experienced institutional transformation in recent decades, and the interaction of national government policy, market forces and the natural environment has influenced urban planning in Chinese metropolises, resulting in urban structures with special characteristics. This paper examines the distribution of location and land use intensity, and tested the Alonso model by the relationship between them in five Chinese metropolises using Point of Interest data, space syntax methodology, the grid weighted statistical method and the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model. Universal patterns about the scaling relation between intensity of land use types and the centrality of location are revealed. The elasticity of land use types to location, from high to low sensitivity, is commercial, residential then industrial land in most of the five metropolises studied. The sensitivity sequence of land use studied suggests that the hypothetical model based on the classical Alonso model can explain the spatial structure of modern metropolises in China to some extent, especially for the commercial land. But the order of sensitivity of residential land and industrial land to location does not conform to the model. The spatial heterogeneity in land use intensity and centrality were explored and the factors embedded were discussed. It can be found that the relation between centrality and land use intensity conforms to power law. In most of the metropolises studied, when the scaling relation between land use intensity and centrality is super linear, the sequence of the frequency value from high to low are commercial, residential and industrial land; when the scaling relation is sublinear, the sequence of the frequency value is industrial, residential and commercial land.},

Paired with smaller and more traditional data, this opens new ways of understanding how people act and move, and how these movements crystallise into the structural patterns observed by censuses. In this article we explore the convergence between mobile phone data and more traditional socioeconomic data from the national census in French cities. We extract mobile phone indicators from six months worth of Call Detail Records (CDR) data, while census and administrative data are used to characterize the socioeconomic organisation of French cities. We address various definitions of cities and investigate how they impact the statistical relationships between mobile phone indicators, such as the number of calls or the entropy of visited cell towers, and measures of economic organisation based on census data, such as the level of deprivation, inequality and segregation. Our findings show that some mobile phone indicators relate significantly with different socioeconomic organisation of cities. However, we show that relations are sensitive to the way cities are defined and delineated. In several cases, changing the city delineation rule can change the significance and even the sign of the correlation. In general, cities delineated in a restricted way (central cores only) exhibit traces of human activity which are less related to their socioeconomic organisation than cities delineated as metropolitan areas and dispersed urban regions.},

In this study, we introduce two examples that demonstrate GSV as a high-quality data source for mapping street greenery and openness. First, the modified green view index, which estimates the visibility of street greenery, was applied to static GSV images in order to map the spatial distribution of street greenery. Second, GSV panoramas were used to quantify and map the openness of street canyons by applying a geometrical transformation and image classification to the panoramas. The results of these two novel applications of street-level photographic data illustrate its utility for quantifying and mapping key urban environmental features at the same viewpoint in which we, as citizens, experience the urban landscape.},

Due to the inevitable connections between human mobility and economic status, estimation of economic trend in advance from easily observable big data in human mobility has the superiority of authenticity, timeliness, and convenience. However, high-precision quantitative relations between human mobility and economic growth remain an outstanding question. To this issue, we firstly analyzed and compared the general patterns of human mobility and economic development; then, a novel, simple, and effective hybrid human mobility indicator (HHMIi) of weighted human mobility networks was proposed to quantitatively estimate economic growth. HHMIi contained two parts, that is, the interaction volumes of a given city with all participation cities and only top hub cities, respectively. This implied that the economic growth of a city is affected by not only its own strength, but also the cooperation with hub cities. Several empirical experiments demonstrated that the proposed HHMIi had an exceedingly high estimation ability of economic growth, especially for the tertiary industry. Compared with other complex network indicators, HHMIi had a distinct advantage and its best accuracy reached 0.9543. These results can provide policy-making supports for inter-city sustainable coordinated development.},

We found that AMoD may lead to changes in accessibility, which will consequently affect people{\textquoteright}s behaviours. Our results show that a scenario in which AMoD is an additional mode is a preferred option, whereas the exclusion of AMoD will lead to lower accessibility for people in the study area.},

	abstract = {Understanding the long-term impact that changes in a city's transportation infrastructure have on its spatial interactions remains a challenge. The difficulty arises from the fact that the real impact may not be revealed in static or aggregated mobility measures, as these are remarkably robust to perturbations. More generally, the lack of longitudinal, cross-sectional data demonstrating the evolution of spatial interactions at a meaningful urban scale also hinders us from evaluating the sensitivity of movement indicators, limiting our capacity to understand the evolution of urban mobility in depth. Using very large mobility records distributed over 3 years, we quantify the impact of the completion of a metro line extension: the Circle Line (CCL) in Singapore. We find that the commonly used movement indicators are almost identical before and after the project was completed. However, in comparing the temporal community structure across years, we do observe significant differences in the spatial reorganization of the affected geographical areas. The completion of CCL enables travellers to re-identify their desired destinations collectively with lower transport cost, making the community structure more consistent. These changes in locality are dynamic and characterized over short timescales, offering us a different approach to identify and analyse the long-term impact of new infrastructures on cities and their evolution dynamics.},

Recently, urban collective mobility patterns have become a hot research direction and has been explored at an unprecedented space{\textendash}time scale due to the emerging big human tracking datasets (e.g., mobile phone data). However, only a few studies have comprehensively quantified the effects of land use on human mobility patterns while considering the influence of the scale of spatial analysis units. This study attempts to reinforce this knowledge by investigating urban human convergence{\textendash}divergence patterns and their relationship with land use distribution characteristics at three popular types of spatial analysis units of human mobility studies (voronoi polygons, grid cells, and traffic analysis zones) using mobile phone data. A case study on Shenzhen, China is implemented, and results indicate that eight distinct convergence{\textendash}divergence patterns could be extracted to describe urban collective mobility patterns despite the use of different types of spatial analysis unit. Moreover, the scale of spatial analysis units exerts a few effects on the quantification of the influence of land use distribution on human convergence{\textendash}divergence patterns, but some common characteristics could be summarized from these discrepant results. The findings can help policy makers understand urban human mobility and can serve as a guide for urban management and planning.},

	abstract = {Urban land use information plays an essential role in a wide variety of urban planning and environmental monitoring processes. During the past few decades, with the rapid technological development of remote sensing (RS), geographic information systems (GIS) and geospatial big data, numerous methods have been developed to identify urban land use at a fine scale. Points-of-interest (POIs) have been widely used to extract information pertaining to urban land use types and functional zones. However, it is difficult to quantify the relationship between spatial distributions of POIs and regional land use types due to a lack of reliable models. Previous methods may ignore abundant spatial features that can be extracted from POIs. In this study, we establish an innovative framework that detects urban land use distributions at the scale of traffic analysis zones (TAZs) by integrating Baidu POIs and a Word2Vec model. This framework was implemented using a Google open-source model of a deep-learning language in 2013. First, data for the Pearl River Delta (PRD) are transformed into a TAZ-POI corpus using a greedy algorithm by considering the spatial distributions of TAZs and inner POIs. Then, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of POIs and TAZs are extracted using the Word2Vec model. Finally, to validate the reliability of the POI/TAZ vectors, we implement a K-Means-based clustering model to analyze correlations between the POI/TAZ vectors and deploy TAZ vectors to identify urban land use types using a random forest algorithm (RFA) model. Compared with some state-of-the-art probabilistic topic models (PTMs), the proposed method can efficiently obtain the highest accuracy (OA = 0.8728, kappa = 0.8399). Moreover, the results can be used to help urban planners to monitor dynamic urban land use and evaluate the impact of urban planning schemes.},

	abstract = {Databases supporting time dependent and continuously changing geometries, called moving ob- jects databases, have been studied for about 15 years. The field has been flourishing and there exist many hundreds, more likely thousands, of publications. However, very few of these results have made it into systems (research prototypes or commercial) and are available for practical use today. It is not that the publications are purely theoretical. In most cases data structures and algorithms have been proposed, implemented, and experimentally evaluated. However, whereas there exists a well established infrastructure for publishing research papers through journals and conferences, no such facilities exist for the publication of the related prototypical implementations. Hence imple- mentations are just done for experiments in the paper and then usually abandoned. This is highly unfortunate even for research, as future proposals of improved algorithms most often have to reim- plement the previous techniques they need to compare to. In this paper we describe an infrastructure for research in moving objects databases that addresses some of these problems. Essentially it allows researchers to implement their new techniques within a system context and to make them available for practical use to all readers of their papers and users of the system. The infrastructure consists of SECONDO, an extensible database system into which a lot of moving object technology has been built already. It offers BerlinMOD, a benchmark to generate large sets of realistic moving object trajectories together with a comprehensive set of queries. Finally, it offers SECONDO Plugins as a facility to publish new research implementations that anyone can merge with a standard SECONDO distribution to have them run in a complete system context.},

	abstract = {A number of recent studies showed that digital footprints around built environments, such as geo-located tweets, are promising data sources for characterizing urban land use. However, challenges for achieving this purpose exist due to the volume and unstructured nature of geo-located social media. Previous studies focused on analyzing Twitter data collectively resulting in coarse resolution maps of urban land use. We argue that the complex spatial structure of a large collection of tweets, when viewed through the lens of individual-level human mobility patterns, can be simplified to a series of key locations for each user, which could be used to characterize urban land use at a higher spatial resolution. Contingent issues that could affect our approach, such as Twitter users{\textquoteright} biases and tendencies at locations where they tweet the most, were systematically investigated using 39 million geo-located Tweets and two independent datasets of the City of Chicago: 1) travel survey and 2) parcel-level land use map. Our results support that the majority of Twitter users show a preferential return, where their digital traces are clustered around a few key locations. However, we did not find a general relation among users between the ranks of locations for an individual{\textemdash}based on the density of tweets{\textemdash}and their land use types. On the contrary, temporal patterns of tweeting at key locations were found to be coherent among the majority of users and significantly associated with land use types of these locations. Furthermore, we used these temporal patterns to classify key locations into generic land use types with an overall classification accuracy of 0.78. The contribution of our research is twofold: a novel approach to resolving land use types at a higher resolution, and in-depth understanding of Twitter users{\textquoteright} location-related and temporal biases, promising to benefit human mobility and urban studies in general.},

	abstract = {The recent boom of sharing economy along with its technological underpinnings have brought new opportunities to urban transport ecosystems. Today, a new mobility option that provides station-less bike rental services is emerging. While previous studies mainly focus on analyzing station-based systems, little is known about how this new mobility service is used in cities. This research proposes an analytical framework to unravel the landscape and pulses of cycling activities from a dockless bike-sharing system. Using a four-month GPS dataset collected from a major bike-sharing operator in Singapore, we reconstruct the temporal usage patterns of shared bikes at different places and apply an eigendecomposition approach to uncover their hidden structures. Several key built environment indicators are then derived and correlated with bicycle usage patterns. According to the analysis results, cycling activities on weekdays possess a variety of temporal profiles at both trip origins and destinations, highlighting substantial variations of bicycle usage across urban locations. Strikingly, a significant proportion of these variations is explained by the cycling activeness in the early morning. On weekends, the overall variations are much smaller, indicating a more uniform distribution of temporal patterns across the city. The correlation analysis reveals the role of shared bikes in facilitating the first- and last-mile trips, while the contribution of the latter (last-mile) is observed to a limited extent. Some built environment indicators, such as residential density, commercial density, and number of road intersections, are correlated with the temporal usage patterns. While others, such as land use mixture and length of cycling path, seem to have less impact. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of eigendecomposition for uncovering the system dynamics. The workflow developed in this research can be applied in other cities to understand this new-generation system as well as the implications for urban design and transport planning.},

	abstract = {Understanding urban vibrancy aids policy-making to foster urban space and therefore has long been a goal of urban studies. Recently, the emerging urban big data and urban analytic methods have enabled us to portray citywide vibrancy. From the social sensing perspective, this study presents a comprehensive and comparative framework to cross-validate urban vibrancy and uncover associated spatial effects. Spatial patterns of urban vibrancy indicated by multisource urban sensing data (points-of-interest, social media check-ins, and mobile phone records) were investigated. A comprehensive urban vibrancy metric was formed by adaptively weighting these metrics. The association between urban vibrancy and demographic, economic, and built environmental factors was revealed with global regression models and local regression models. An empirical experiment was conducted in Shenzhen. The results demonstrate that four urban vibrancy metrics are all higher in the special economic zone (SEZ) and lower in non-SEZs but with different degrees of spatial aggregation. The influences of employment and road density on all vibrancy metrics are significant and positive. However, the effects of metro stations, land use mix, building footprints, and distance to district center depend on the vibrancy indicator and location. These findings unravel the commonalities and differences in urban vibrancy metrics derived from multisource urban big data and the hidden spatial dynamics of the influences of associated factors. They further suggest that urban policies should be proposed to foster vibrancy in Shenzhen therefore benefit social wellbeing and urban development in the long term. They also provide valuable insights into the reliability of urban big data-driven urban studies.},

In recent years, a considerable amount of work has been developed around the use of social media data, most of which focusses on mining the content, with comparatively less attention given to the location information. Furthermore, what aggregated scale spatial patterns show still needs extensive discussion. This paper proposes a tweet-topic-function-structure framework to reveal spatial patterns from individual tweets at aggregated spatial levels, combining an unsupervised learning algorithm with spatial measures. Two-year geo-tweets collected in Greater London were analyzed as a demonstrator of the framework and as a case study. The results indicate, at a disaggregated level, that the distribution of topics possess a fair degree of spatial randomness related to tweeting behavior. When aggregating tweets by zones, the areas with the same topics form spatial clusters but of entangled urban functions. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering generates a clear spatial structure with orders of centers. Our work demonstrates that although uncertainties exist, geo-tweets should still be a useful resource for informing spatial planning, especially for the strategic planning of economic clusters.},

In previous studies, the natural correspondence across multi-source geospatial data has often been ignored in the description of one object, which would influence the performance of data fusion. Therefore, this study introduces the cross-correlations mechanism to achieve the natural correspondence by taking remote sensing images, point of interest (POI), and real-time social media users as an example. It proposes a new cross-correlations based functional urban land use (CC-FLU) model to infer urban functions. The presented model extracts physical and human semantic features from multi-source geospatial data, then maps them to their common subspaces to obtain their cross-correlations respectively. These semantic features and their cross-correlations are integrated together to classify urban functions. An experiment in Shenzhen, China was implemented to evaluate the performance of the presented model at a fine scale. The results show that the proposed CC-FLU model achieved a better performance than previous methods, yielding OA and Kappa values of 0.851 and 0.812, respectively. The results of the presented approach outperform those of methods using one single source geospatial data. The results demonstrate that the skilled information of each type of geospatial data is fully melted into the data fusion model, and simultaneously achieves the natural correspondence across multi-source geospatial data. Moreover, this study resolves the possible disadvantages of models using one single source data and fusion methods by sequentially concatenating multi-source features. The results will benefit urban planners and urban policy-makers.},

Although several studies have confirmed the efficacy of remote sensing imagery in urban studies, coupling remote sensing and new human sensing data like mobile phone positioning data to identify urban functional zones has still not been investigated. In this study, a new framework integrating remote sensing imagery and mobile phone positioning data was developed to analyze urban functional zones with landscape and human activity metrics. Landscapes metrics were calculated based on land cover from remote sensing images. Human activities were extracted from massive mobile phone positioning data. By integrating them, urban functional zones (urban center, sub-center, suburbs, urban buffer, transit region and ecological area) were identified by a hierarchical clustering. Finally, gradient analysis in three typical transects was conducted to investigate the pattern of landscapes and human activities. Taking Shenzhen, China, as an example, the conducted experiment shows that the pattern of landscapes and human activities in the urban functional zones in Shenzhen does not totally conform to the classical urban theories. It demonstrates that the fusion of remote sensing imagery and human sensing data can characterize the complex urban spatial structure in Shenzhen well. Urban functional zones have the potential to act as bridges between the urban structure, human activity and urban planning policy, providing scientific support for rational urban planning and sustainable urban development policymaking.},

	abstract = {Urban region function recognition is key to rational urban planning and management. Due to the complex socioeconomic nature of functional land use, recognizing urban region function in high-density cities using remote sensing images alone is difficult. The inclusion of social sensing has the potential to improve the function classification performance. However, effectively integrating the multi-source and multi-modal remote and social sensing data remains technically challenging. In this paper, we have proposed a novel end-to-end deep learning-based remote and social sensing data fusion model to address this issue. Two neural network based methods, one based on a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) and the other based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, have been developed to automatically extract discriminative time-dependent social sensing signature features, which are fused with remote sensing image features extracted via a residual neural network. One of the major difficulties in exploiting social and remote sensing data is that the two data sources are asynchronous. We have developed a deep learning-based strategy to address this missing modality problem by enforcing cross-modal feature consistency (CMFC) and cross-modal triplet (CMT) constraints. We train the model in an end-to-end manner by simultaneously optimizing three costs, including the classification cost, the CMFC cost and the CMT cost. Extensive experiments have been conducted on publicly available datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in fusing remote and social sensing data for urban region function recognition. The results show that the seemingly unrelated physically sensed image data and social activities sensed signatures can indeed complement each other to help enhance the accuracy of urban region function recognition.},

	abstract = {Every day, billions of mobile network events (i.e. CDRs) are generated by cellular phone operator companies. Latent in this data are inspiring insights about human actions and behaviors, the discovery of which is important because context-aware applications and services hold the key to user-driven, intelligent services, which can enhance our everyday lives such as social and economic development, urban planning, and health prevention. The major challenge in this area is that interpreting such a big stream of data requires a deep understanding of mobile network events' context through available background knowledge. This article addresses the issues in context awareness given heterogeneous and uncertain data of mobile network events missing reliable information on the context of this activity. The contribution of this research is a model from a combination of logical and statistical reasoning standpoints for enabling human activity inference in qualitative terms from open geographical data that aimed at improving the quality of human behaviors recognition tasks from CDRs. We use open geographical data, Openstreetmap (OSM), as a proxy for predicting the content of human activity in the area. The user study performed in Trento shows that predicted human activities (top level) match the survey data with around 93\% overall accuracy. The extensive validation for predicting a more specific economic type of human activity performed in Barcelona, by employing credit card transaction data. The analysis identifies that appropriately normalized data on points of interest (POI) is a good proxy for predicting human economical activities, with 84\% accuracy on average. So the model is proven to be efficient for predicting the context of human activity, when its total level could be efficiently observed from cell phone data records, missing contextual information however.},

In the era of big data, we have access to individual-level data, but the acquisition of high-quality spatial interaction data remains a challenging problem. Most research has been focused on distributions of movable objects or the modelling of spatial interaction patterns, with few attempts to identify hidden spatial interaction patterns from temporal transitions of spatial distributions. In this article, we introduced an approach to infer spatial interaction patterns from sequential snapshots of spatial population distributions by incorporating linear programming and the spatial constraints of human movement. Experiments using synthetic data were conducted using four simple scenarios to explore the characteristics of our method. The proposed method was used to extract interurban flows of migrants during the Chinese Spring Festival in 2016. Our research demonstrated the feasibility of using discrete multi-temporal snapshots of population distributions in space to infer spatial interaction patterns and offered a general analytical framework from snapshot data to spatial interaction patterns.},

	abstract = {Spatial interpolation is a traditional geostatistical operation that aims at predicting the attribute values of unobserved locations given a sample of data defined on point supports. However, the continuity and heterogeneity underlying spatial data are too complex to be approximated by classic statistical models. Deep learning models, especially the idea of conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs), provide us with a perspective for formalizing spatial interpolation as a conditional generative task. In this article, we design a novel deep learning architecture named conditional encoder-decoder generative adversarial neural networks (CEDGANs) for spatial interpolation, therein combining the encoder-decoder structure with adversarial learning to capture deep representations of sampled spatial data and their interactions with local structural patterns. A case study on elevations in China demonstrates the ability of our model to achieve outstanding interpolation results compared to benchmark methods. Further experiments uncover the learned spatial knowledge in the model{\textquoteright}s hidden layers and test the potential to generalize our adversarial interpolation idea across domains. This work is an endeavor to investigate deep spatial knowledge using artificial intelligence. The proposed model can benefit practical scenarios and enlighten future research in various geographical applications related to spatial prediction.},

	abstract = {Inferring the unknown properties of a place relies on both its observed attributes and the characteristics of the places to which it is connected. Because place characteristics are unstructured and the metrics for place connections can be diverse, it is challenging to incorporate them in a spatial prediction task where the results could be affected by how the neighborhoods are delineated and where the true relevance among places is hard to identify. To bridge the gap, we introduce graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) to model places as a graph, where each place is formalized as a node, place characteristics are encoded as node features, and place connections are represented as the edges. GCNNs capture the knowledge of the relevant geographic context by optimizing the weights among graph neural network layers. A case study was designed in the Beijing metropolitan area to predict the unobserved place characteristics based on the observed properties and specific place connections. A series of comparative experiments was conducted to highlight the influence of different place connection measures on the prediction accuracy and to evaluate the predictability across different characteristic dimensions. This research enlightens the promising future of GCNNs in formalizing places for geographic knowledge representation and reasoning.},

	abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

While, traditionally, mobility information has been collected via surveys, the pervasive adoption of mobile technologies has brought a wealth of (real time) data. The easy access to this information opens the door to study theoretical questions so far unexplored. In this work, we show for a series of worldwide cities that commuting daily flows can be mapped into a well behaved vector field, fulfilling the divergence theorem and which is, besides, irrotational. This property allows us to define a potential for the field that can become a major instrument to determine separate mobility basins and discern contiguous urban areas. We also show that empirical fluxes and potentials can be well reproduced and analytically characterized using the so-called gravity model, while other models based on intervening opportunities have serious difficulties.},

It is also an attempt to transpose this classification to a fine grained level of detail. The urban space is divided into virtual sensors for which five morphological indicators are calculated. Therefore, this work exposes a comparison of two methods dividing the urban space: the Delaunay triangulation versus a Skeletonization. These algorithms are based on a standard vector dataset and integrated in a free and open source Geographic Information System. These algorithms are applied to New York and districts of Nantes. The skeletonization presents the advantage of pulling down the calculation time without affecting the accuracy. Moreover, the methodology proposed is reproducible everywhere. In addition, the major LCZ obtained on the districts of Nantes are verified by comparison to previous measurements and classifications, which supports the results presented in this paper. Finally, the methodology and functionalities developed in this paper seem useful for the urban climate community and town planners, because LCZ can provide input data for numerical climate models that incorporate urban canopy parameters to forecast climate variables and forecast Urban heat island (UHI).},

	abstract = {Delineating travel patterns and city structure has long been a core research topic in transport geography. Different from the physical structure, the city structure beneath the complex travel-flow system shows the inherent connection patterns within the city. On the basis of taxi-trip data from Shanghai, we built spatially embedded networks to model intra-city spatial interactions and to introduce network science methods into the analysis. The community detection method is applied to reveal sub-regional structures, and several network measures are used to examine the properties of sub-regions. Considering the differences between long- and short-distance trips, we reveal a two-level hierarchical polycentric city structure in Shanghai. Further explorations of sub-network structures demonstrate that urban sub-regions have broader internal spatial interactions, while suburban centers are more influential on local traffic. By incorporating the land use of centers from a travel-pattern perspective, we investigate sub-region formation and the interaction patterns of center{\textendash}local places. This study provides insights into using emerging data sources to reveal travel patterns and city structures, which could potentially aid in developing and applying urban transportation policies. The sub-regional structures revealed in this study are more easily interpreted for transportation-related issues than for other structures, such as administrative divisions.},

	abstract = {Cities are some of the most complex dynamical systems in human societies and in nature. There is growing interest in producing more comprehensive quantitative theory, capable of describing many of the features now observable in urban environments, especially those that show empirical regularities across cities of different sizes, geographies, and levels of development. The principal challenge of achieving such a goal is our ability to build frameworks that include realistic but simple accounts of agents' choices and strategic behavior, beyond current approaches in statistical physics or economics. Here, I propose a general framework that integrates agents' behavior with their resource and information management towards seizing opportunities in their environment. I show how this approach integrates urban scaling theory with a statistical mechanics of open-ended (economic) growth. The framework is general and, with appropriate modifications and elaborations, can account for the statistical dynamics of other complex systems.

Fast urbanisation may lead to similar urban forms due to similar habits and strategies of city planning. However, whether urban forms in China are identical or significantly different has not been empirically investigated. In this paper, urban forms are investigated based on two spatial units: city and block. The boundaries of natural cities in terms of the density of human settlements and activities are delineated with the concept of {\textquoteleft}redefined city{\textquoteright} using points of interests (POIs), and blocks are determined by road networks. Urban forms are characterised by city-block two-level spatial morphologies. Further, redefined cities are classified into four hierarchies to examine the effects of different city development stages on urban forms. The spatial morphology is explained by urbanisation variables to understand the effects. Results show that the urban forms are spatially clustered from the perspective of city-block two-level morphologies. Urban forms tend to be similar within the same hierarchies, but significantly varied among different hierarchies, which is closely related to the development stages. Additionally, the spatial dimensional indicators of urbanisation could explain 41\% of the spatial morphology of redefined cities.},

In this article, we develop original, network-based measures of what we call {\textquotedblleft}structural connectedness{\textquotedblright} based on the everyday travel of people across neighborhoods. Our principal index captures the extent to which residents in each neighborhood of a city travel to all other neighborhoods in equal proportion. Our secondary index captures the extent to which travels within a city are concentrated in a handful of receiving neighborhoods. We illustrate the value of our indices for the 50 largest American cities based on hundreds of millions of geotagged tweets over 18 months. We uncover important features of major American cities, including the extent to which their connectedness depends on a few neighborhood hubs, and the fact that in several cities, contact between some neighborhoods is all but nonexistent. We also show that cities with greater population densities, more cosmopolitanism, and less racial segregation have higher levels of structural connectedness. Our indices can be applied to data at any spatial scale, and our measures pave the way for more powerful and precise analyses of structural connectedness and its effects across a broad array of social phenomena.},

Using a database of geotagged tweets in the Madrid Metropolitan Area over a two-year period, this article describes the steps followed in the preparation and cleansing of the initial data and the visualisation of the results in Geographic Information Systems in the form of home-work matrices. The Origin-Destination matrices obtained were then compared with the official data provided by the Madrid Transport Consortium from the 2014 Synthetic Mobility Survey. The results of this comparison demonstrate that the level of precision offered by Twitter as a source of geographic information is adequate and efficient, thereby permitting a more in-depth analysis of flows between different zones of interest in the study area.},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence supports the fact that cities are complex systems, with a broad spectrum of structural and dynamical features which lead to unexpected and emerging phenomena. Understanding urban dynamics at individual level -- but also as the outcome of collective human behaviour -- will open the doors to uncountable applications ranging from enhancing the sustainability and the resilience of the city to improving health and well-being of its inhabitants. Here, we use a unique data set of longitudinal human flows provided by Foursquare, a leader platform for location intelligence, to characterize the functional organization of a city. First, we build multidimensional network models of human flows corresponding to different types of activities across time. We quantify the efficiency of flow exchange between areas of a city in terms of integration and segregation, respectively. Results reveal unexpected complex spatio-temporal patterns that allow us to gain new insight on the function of 10 megacities worldwide. We discover that large cities tend to be more segregated and less integrated, and that human flows at different hours of the day or between different types of activities enable the identification of different "cities within the city" which indeed show clear dissimilarities in terms of both functional integration and segregation. Our analysis provides new insights on how human behaviour influences, and is influenced by, the urban environment and, as an interesting byproduct, to characterize functional (dis)similarities of different metropolitan areas, countries, and cultures.},

Using the origin-destination matrix, we obtain a rank, called "OD rank{\textquotedblright}, analogous to the page rank of Google, that gives the more relevant places in New York City in terms of taxi trips. We introduced a model that captures the local and global dynamics that agrees with the data.

	abstract = {Activity-based models appeared as an answer to the limitations of the traditional trip-based and tour-based four-stage models. The fundamental assumption of activity-based models is that travel demand is originated from people performing their daily activities. This is why they include a consistent representation of time, of the persons and households, time-dependent routing, and microsimulation of travel demand and traffic. In spite of their potential to simulate traffic demand management policies, their practical application is still limited. One of the main reasons is that these models require a huge amount of very detailed input data hard to get with surveys. However, the pervasive use of mobile devices has brought a valuable new source of data. The work presented here has a twofold objective: first, to demonstrate the capability of mobile phone records to feed activity-based transport models, and, second, to assert the advantages of using activity-based models to estimate the effects of traffic demand management policies. Activity diaries for the metropolitan area of Barcelona are reconstructed from mobile phone records. This information is then employed as input for building a transport MATSim model of the city. The model calibration and validation process proves the quality of the activity diaries obtained. The possible impacts of a cordon toll policy applied to two different areas of the city and at different times of the day are then studied. Our results show the way in which the modal share is modified in each of the considered scenarios. The possibility of evaluating the effects of the policy at both aggregated and traveller level, together with the ability of the model to capture policy impacts beyond the cordon toll area confirm the advantages of activity-based models for the evaluation of traffic demand management policies.},

	abstract = {Human mobility has a significant impact on several layers of society, from infrastructural planning and economics to the spread of diseases and crime. Representing the system as a complex network, in which nodes are assigned to regions (e.g., a city) and links indicate the flow of people between two of them, physics-inspired models have been proposed to quantify the number of people migrating from one city to the other. Despite the advances made by these models, our ability to predict the number of commuters and reconstruct mobility networks remains limited. Here, we propose an alternative approach using machine learning and 22 urban indicators to predict the flow of people and reconstruct the intercity commuters network. Our results reveal that predictions based on machine learning algorithms and urban indicators can reconstruct the commuters network with 90.4\% of accuracy and describe 77.6\% of the variance observed in the flow of people between cities. We also identify essential features to recover the network structure and the urban indicators mostly related to commuting patterns. As previously reported, distance plays a significant role in commuting, but other indicators, such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and unemployment rate, are also driven-forces for people to commute. We believe that our results shed new lights on the modeling of migration and reinforce the role of urban indicators on commuting patterns. Also, because link-prediction and network reconstruction are still open challenges in network science, our results have implications in other areas, like economics, social sciences, and biology, where node attributes can give us information about the existence of links connecting entities in the network.},

This paper analyzes the travel demand characteristics of mobility networks through studying a coarse-grained representation of individual trips. Building on the idea of reducing the complexity of the mobility network, we investigate the preserved spatial and temporal information in a simplified representations of large-scale origin-destination matrices derived from more than 16 million taxi trip records from New York and Chicago. We reduce the numerous individual flows on the network into four major groups, to uncover latent collective mobility patterns in those cities. The new simplified representation of the origin-destination matrices leads to categorization of trips into distinctive flow types with specific temporal and spatial properties in each city under study. Collocation of the descriptive statistics of flow types within the two cities suggests the generalizability of the proposed approach. We extract an overall displacement metric from each of the major flows to analyze the evolution of their temporal attributes. The new representation of the demand network reveals insightful properties of the mobility system which could not have been identified from the original disaggregated representation.},

	abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics system, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difficult to train for a fixed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

This method applies the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to classify regions{\textquoteright} inflow and trip count characteristics. It regroups these urban regions using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) clustering method based on those typical characteristics. Using a large amount of vehicle trajectory data (approximately 1,500,000 data points) in the Chinese city of Chengdu, we demonstrate that the method can discriminate between urban functional regions, by comparing the proportion of surface objects within each region. This research shows that vehicle trajectory data in different functional urban regions possesses different time-series curves, while similar types of functional regions can be identified by these curves. Compared with remote sensing images and other statistical methods which can provide only static results, our research can provide a timely and effective approach to determine an urban region{\textquoteright}s functions.},

The model is built on a fitness function that computes the difference between the observed results produced from remote-sensing images and the simulated results produced by a general CA model. GPS optimization incorporating genetic algorithms (GAs) searches for the minimum difference, i.e. the smallest accumulated residuals, in fitting the CA transition rules. The CA coefficients captured by the GPS method have clear physical meanings that are closely associated with the dynamic mechanisms of land-use change. The GPS-CA model was applied to simulate urban land-use change in Kunshan City in the Yangtze River Delta from 2000 to 2015. The results show that the GPS method had a smaller root mean squared error (0.2821) than a logistic regression (LR) method (0.5256) in fitting the CA transition rules. The GPS-CA model thus outperformed the LR-CA model, with an overall accuracy improvement of 4.7\%. As a result, the GPS-CA model should be a superior tool for modeling land-use change as well as predicting future scenarios in response to different conditions to support the sustainable urban development.},

	abstract = {Urban green space (UGS) is an indispensable component of urban environmental systems and is important to urban residents. Both physical features (e.g., shrubs, trees) and social functions (e.g., public parks, green buffers) are important in UGS mapping. Most UGS studies rely solely on remote sensing data to conduct UGS mapping of physical features, and few studies have focused on UGS mapping from a social function perspective. Due to the limitations of remote sensing in identifying social features; social sensing, which can reflect socioeconomic characteristics, is needed. As a result, a novel methodological framework for integrating these two different data sources to conduct the social functional mapping of UGS has been required. Consequently, we first extracted vegetation patches from an area in Beijing, via the Hyperplanes for Plant Extraction Methodology (HPEM) and considered the parcels segmented by the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road networks as the basic analytical units. Then, near-convex-hull analysis (NCHA) and text-concave-hull analysis (TCHA) were performed to integrate the multi-source data. The results show that the Level I and Level II (refer to Table 3) social function types of UGS had overall accuracies of 92.48\% and 88.76\%, respectively. Our study provides an improved understanding of UGS and can assist government departments in urban planning. It can also help researchers broaden their research scope by acting as a freely available data source for their work.},

As a result, an automatic/semi-automatic method for mapping urban functional zones is highly required. Hierarchical semantic cognition (HSC) is presented in this study, and serves as a general cognition structure for recognizing urban functional zones. Unlike traditional classification methods, the HSC relies on geographic cognition and considers four semantic layers, i.e., visual features, object categories, spatial object patterns, and zone functions, as well as their hierarchical relations. Here, we used HSC to classify functional zones in Beijing with a very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite image and point-of-interest (POI) data. Experimental results indicate that this method can produce more accurate results than Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with a larger overall accuracy of 90.8\%. Additionally, the contributions of diverse semantic layers are quantified: the object-category layer is the most important and makes 54\% contribution to functional-zone classification; while, other semantic layers are less important but their contributions cannot be ignored. Consequently, the presented HSC is effective in classifying urban functional zones, and can further support urban planning and management.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is a set of interrelated processes; the most visible among them are changes in the built-up environment. We relate those changes to human activity as expressed by online social media messages. This approach might shed light on urban dynamics currently intractable through existing datasets and methodologies. Microwave remote sensing images are used to identify urban built-up areas and changes within those areas in an objective way, while geocoded mobile social media messages deliver valuable information about human activity and the vitality found in those areas. A time-series stack of 36 TerraSAR-X Stripmap images and roughly six million social media messages were processed, classified, and visually and quantitatively analyzed for an experiment in Shanghai. We derived four possible cases of land classification by combining the results of both sources to a single raster layer at a 400m cell size. Quantifying these cases in a 2-by-2 confusion matrix shows positive and negative matches between built-up areas and social media messages. We see that correlation of positive matches is 72\%. A combination of remotely sensed and social media data is a step towards a more granular analysis of urbanization processes than is possible from either data source alone. We put people in the picture of traditional remote sensing analysis.},

The recent, explosive growth of online geo-referenced photo collections suggests an alternate approach to geographic knowledge discovery. In this work, we present a general framework that uses ground-level images from Flickr for land use mapping. Our approach benefits from several novel aspects. First, we address the nosiness of the online photo collections, such as imprecise geolocation and uneven spatial distribution, by performing location and indoor/outdoor filtering, and semi-supervised dataset augmentation. Our indoor/outdoor classifier achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and approaches human-level accuracy. Second, we utilize high-level semantic image features extracted using deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks, which allow us to achieve upwards of 76\% accuracy on a challenging eight class land use mapping problem.},

To address this issue, we have developed a protocol to identify urban land use functions over large areas using satellite images and open social data. We first derived parcels from road networks contained in Open Street Map (OSM) and used the parcels as the basic mapping unit. We then used 10 features derived from Points of Interest (POI) data and two indices obtained from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to classify parcels into eight Level I classes and sixteen Level II classes of land use. Similarity measures and threshold methods were used to identify land use types in the classification process. This protocol was tested in Beijing, China. The results showed that the generated land use map had an overall accuracy of 81.04\% and 69.89\% for Level I and Level II classes, respectively. The map revealed significantly more details of the spatial pattern of land uses in Beijing than the land use map released by the government.},

	abstract = {Urban land use information plays an important role in urban management, government policy-making, and population activity monitoring. However, the accurate classification of urban functional zones is challenging due to the complexity of urban systems. Many studies have focused on urban land use classification by considering features that are extracted from either high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images or social media data, but few studies consider both features due to the lack of available models. In our study, we propose a novel scene classification framework to identify dominant urban land use type at the level of traffic analysis zone by integrating probabilistic topic models and support vector machine. A land use word dictionary inside the framework was built by fusing natural{\textendash}physical features from HSR images and socioeconomic semantic features from multisource social media data. In addition to comparing with manual interpretation data, we designed several experiments to test the land use classification accuracy of our proposed model with different combinations of previously acquired semantic features. The classification results (overall accuracy = 0.865, Kappa = 0.828) demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy that blends features extracted from multisource geospatial data as semantic features to train the classification model. This method can be applied to help urban planners analyze fine urban structures and monitor urban land use changes, and additional data from multiple sources will be blended into this proposed framework in the future.},

Several methods have been proposed to obtain land use maps of urban areas, and these can be classified into two categories: remote sensing methods and social sensing methods. However, remote sensing and social sensing approaches have specific disadvantages regarding the description of social and physical features, respectively. Therefore, an appropriate fusion strategy is vital for large-area land use mapping. To address this issue, we propose an efficient land use mapping method that combines remote sensing imagery (RSI) and mobile phone positioning data (MPPD) for large areas. We implemented this method in two steps. First, a support vector machine was adopted to classify the RSI and MPPD. Then, the two classification results were fused using a decision fusion strategy to generate the land use map. The proposed method was applied to a case study of the central area of Beijing. The experimental results show that the proposed method improved classification accuracy compared with that achieved using MPPD alone, validating the efficacy of this new approach for identifying land use. Based on the land use map and MPPD data, activity density in key zones during daytime and nighttime was analyzed to illustrate the volume and variation of people working and living across different regions.},

Prior studies using street-level imagery focus primarily on urban physical environment auditing. In this study, we demonstrate the potential usage of street-level imagery in uncovering spatio-temporal urban mobility patterns. Our method assumes that the streetscape depicted in street-level imagery reflects urban functions and that urban streets of similar functions exhibit similar temporal mobility patterns. We present how a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can be trained to identify high-level scene features from street view images that can explain up to 66.5\% of the hourly variation of taxi trips along with the urban road network. The study shows that street-level imagery, as the counterpart of remote sensing imagery, provides an opportunity to infer fine-scale human activity information of an urban region and bridge gaps between the physical space and human space. This approach can therefore facilitate urban environment observation and smart urban planning.},

Such classification is usually a patch-wise or pixel-wise labeling over the whole image. But for many applications, such as urban population density mapping or urban utility planning, a classification map based on individual buildings is much more informative. However, such semantic classification still poses some fundamental challenges, for example, how to retrieve fine boundaries of individual buildings. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for classifying the functionality of individual buildings. The proposed method is based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which classify fa{\c c}ade structures from street view images, such as Google StreetView, in addition to remote sensing images which usually only show roof structures. Geographic information was utilized to mask out individual buildings, and to associate the corresponding street view images. We created a benchmark dataset which was used for training and evaluating CNNs. In addition, the method was applied to generate building classification maps on both region and city scales of several cities in Canada and the US.},

However, it is difficult to quantify the correct mix or the spatial relations among different POI types indicative of specific urban functions. In this research, we develop a statistical framework to help discover semantically meaningful topics and functional regions based on the co-occurrence patterns of POI types. The framework applies the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique and incorporates user check-in activities on location-based social networks. Using a large corpus of about 100,000 Foursquare venues and user check-in behavior in the 10 most populated urban areas of the US, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology by identifying distinctive types of latent topics and, further, by extracting urban functional regions using K-means clustering and Delaunay triangulation spatial constraints clustering. We show that a region can support multiple functions but with different probabilities, while the same type of functional region can span multiple geographically non-adjacent locations. Since each region can be modeled as a vector consisting of multinomial topic distributions, similar regions with regard to their thematic topic signatures can be identified. Compared with remote sensing images which mainly uncover the physical landscape of urban environments, our popularity-based POI topic modeling approach can be seen as a complementary social sensing view on urban space based on human activities.},

However, little work has been conducted to reveal how multi-modal transportation data impact on this identification process. In our study, we propose a data-driven approach that addresses the relationships between travel behavior and urban structure: first, multi-modal transportation data are aggregated to extract explicit statistical features; then, topic modeling methods are applied to transform these explicit statistical features into latent semantic features; and finally, a classification method is used to identify functional zones with similar latent topic distributions. Two 10-day-long {\textquotedblleft}big{\textquotedblright} datasets from the 2,370 bicycle stations of the public bicycle-sharing system, and up to 9,992 taxi cabs within the core urban area of Hangzhou City, China, as well as point-of-interest data are tested to reveal the extent to which different travel modes contribute to the detection and understanding of urban land functions. Our results show that: (1) using latent semantic features delineated from the topic modeling process as the classification input outperforms approaches using explicit statistical features; (2) combining multi-modal data visibly improves the accuracy and consistency of the identified functional zones; and (3) the proposed data-driven approach is also capable of identifying mixed land use in the urban space.

	abstract = {Land-use maps are important references for urban planning and urban studies. Given the heterogeneity of urban land-use types, it is difficult to differentiate different land-use types based on overhead remotely sensed data. Google Street View (GSV) images, which capture the fa{\c c}ades of building blocks along streets, could be better used to judge the land-use types of different building blocks based on their fa{\c c}ade appearances. Recently developed scene classification algorithms in computer vision community make it possible to categorize different photos semantically based on various image feature descriptors and machine-learning algorithms. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a method to derive detailed land-use information at building block level based on scene classification algorithms and GSV images. Three image feature descriptors (i.e., scale-invariant feature transform-Fisher, histogram of oriented gradients, GIST) were used to represent GSV images of different buildings. Existing land-use maps were used to create training datasets to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for categorizing GSV images. The trained SVM classifiers were then applied to case study areas in New York City, Boston, and Houston, to predict the land-use information at building block level. Accuracy assessment results show that the proposed method is suitable for differentiating residential buildings and nonresidential buildings with an accuracy of 85\% or so. Since the GSV images are publicly accessible, this proposed method would provide a new way for building block level land-use mapping in future.},

	abstract = {Multimedia researchers have exploited large collections of community-contributed geo-referenced images to better understand a particular image, such as its subject matter or where it was taken, as well as to better understand a geographic location, such as the most visited tourist spots in a city or what the local cuisine is like. The goal of this paper is to better understand location. In particular, we use geo-referenced image collections to better understand what occurs in different parts of a city at fine spatial and activity class scales. This problem is known as land use mapping in the geographical sciences. We propose a novel framework to perform fine-grained land use mapping at the city scale using ground-level images. Mapping land use is considerably more difficult than mapping land cover and is generally not possible using overhead imagery as it requires close-up views and seeing inside buildings. We postulate that the growing collections of geo-referenced, ground-level images suggest an alternate approach to this geographic knowledge discovery problem. We develop a general framework that uses Flickr images to map 45 different land-use classes for the city of San Francisco, CA, USA. Individual images are classified using a novel convolutional neural network containing two streams: one for recognizing objects and another for recognizing scenes. This network is trained in an end-to-end manner directly on the labeled training images. We propose several novel strategies to overcome the noisiness of our user-generated data including search-based training set augmentation and online adaptive training. We derive a ground truth map of San Francisco in order to evaluate our method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through geovisualization and quantitative analysis. Our framework achieves over 29\% recall at the individual land parcel level that represents a strong baseline for the challenging 45-way land use classification problem, especially given the noisiness of the image data.},

It conveys human mobility and activity information, which can be closely related to the land use of a region. This paper discusses the potential use of taxi traces for urban land-use classification, particularly for recognizing the social function of urban land by using one year's trace data from 4000 taxis. First, we found that pick-up/set-down dynamics, extracted from taxi traces, exhibited clear patterns corresponding to the land-use classes of these regions. Second, with six features designed to characterize the pick-up/set-down pattern, land-use classes of regions could be recognized. Classification results using the best combination of features achieved a recognition accuracy of 95\%. Third, the classification results also highlighted regions that changed land-use class from one to another, and such land-use class transition dynamics of regions revealed unusual real-world social events. Moreover, the pick-up/set-down dynamics could further reflect to what extent each region is used as a certain class.},

	abstract = {Many Chinese cities are becoming more polycentric during the last decade of rapid urban expansion. In this study, we attempt to explore the relationship between travel behaviour and polycentric built environment for both work and non-work trips by multiple multinomial logit mode choice models for work and non-work travel. The choice set is comprised of: driving a private car, taking the bus and taking the subway. The empirical analysis in this paper is based on the 2005 Shenzhen Personal Travel Survey. The model specifications tested a set of variables describing trip mode attributes, household socio-demographics, and polycentric centre types such as regional centres, district centres, district subcentres and suburbs. The results indicate that urban form is an important factor in affecting mode choice: people living or working in a regional city centre are more likely to take public transportation, compared to those living in subcentres and suburbs. The results also imply that people perceive a higher influence of built environment on mode choice for work trips than non-work trips. These research findings support the contention that different types of urban centres can meaningfully influence how residents travel, even after controlling for socio-economic characteristics. Resumen. Muchas ciudades chinas han estado haci{\'e}ndose cada vez m{\'a}s polic{\'e}ntricas durante la r{\'a}pida expansi{\'o}n de la {\'u}ltima d{\'e}cada. En este estudio, intentamos explorar la relaci{\'o}n entre el comportamiento respecto al transporte urbano y los entornos polic{\'e}ntricos en relaci{\'o}n con los desplazamientos por motivos laborales y no laborales, empleando modelos de selecci{\'o}n de modo logit multinomial m{\'u}ltiple para desplazamientos laborales y no laborales. El abanico de elecci{\'o}n se compone de: utilizar el propio veh{\'i}culo, tomar el autob{\'u}s y tomar el metro. El an{\'a}lisis emp{\'i}rico de este art{\'i}culo se basa en la Encuesta Personal de Transporte en Shenzen de 2005. Las especificaciones del modelo han experimentado con un conjunto de variables que describen atributos del modo de viajar, la socio-demograf{\'i}a de los hogares, y los diferentes tipos de centros polic{\'e}ntricos, como pueden ser centros regionales, de distrito, subcentros de distrito y suburbios. Los resultados indican que la configuraci{\'o}n urbana es un factor importante que afecta el modo de selecci{\'o}n: es m{\'a}s probable que las personas que viven o trabajan en un centro de ciudad regional usen el transporte p{\'u}blico, en comparaci{\'o}n con las que viven en subcentros y en los suburbios. Los resultados implican asimismo que las personas perciben una mayor influencia del entorno urbano al seleccionar el modo de desplazamiento al trabajo en comparaci{\'o}n con los desplazamientos no laborales. Estos hallazgos apoyan el argumento de que los diferentes tipos de centros urbanos pueden influir poderosamente en el modo de desplazamiento de los residentes, incluso despu{\'e}s de controlar las caracter{\'i}sticas socioecon{\'o}micas.},

However it is still a challenging problem that has been addressed only with topological information in recent years. Based on the belief that network nodes with a great number of common neighbors are more likely to be connected, many similarity indices have achieved considerable accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by the natural assumption that the effect of missing links on the estimation of a node{\textquoteright}s clustering ability could be related to node degree, in this paper, we propose a degree-related clustering coefficient index to quantify the clustering ability of nodes. Unlike the classical clustering coefficient, our new coefficient is highly robust when the observed bias of links is considered. Furthermore, we propose a degree-related clustering ability path (DCP) index, which applies the proposed coefficient to the link prediction problem. Experiments on 12 real-world networks show that our proposed method is highly accurate and robust compared with four common-neighbor-based similarity indices (Common Neighbors(CN), Adamic-Adar(AA), Resource Allocation(RA), and Preferential Attachment(PA)), and the recently introduced clustering ability (CA) index.},

	abstract = {Understanding human movements and their interactions with the built environment has long been a research interest in transport geography. In recent years, two important types of urban mobility datasets {\textemdash} smart card transactions and taxi GPS trajectories {\textemdash} have been used extensively but often separately to quantify travel patterns as well as urban spatial structures. Despite the fruitful research outcomes, the relationships between different types of transport flows in the same geographic area remain poorly understood. In this research, we propose an analytical framework to compare urban mobility patterns extracted from these two data sources. Using Singapore as a case study, this research introduces a three-fold comparative analysis to understand: (1) the spatial distributions of public transit and taxi usages and their relative balance; (2) the distance decay of travel distance, and (3) the spatial interaction communities extracted from the two transport modes. The research findings reveal that the spatial distributions of travel demand extracted from the two transport modes exhibit high correlations. However, more in-depth analysis (based on rank-size distribution and log odds ratio) reveals a higher degree of spatial heterogeneity in public transit usage. The travel distance of trips from public transit decays faster than that of taxi trips, highlighting the importance of taxis in facilitating long-distance travels. Both types of trips decay much faster when travel distance is beyond 20 km, which corresponds to the average distance from the urban periphery to the center. The spatial interaction communities derived from public transit are different on weekdays and weekends, while those of taxis show similar patterns. Both transport modes yield communities that reveal the city's polycentric structure, but their differences indicate that each of the transport modes plays a specific role in connecting certain places in the city. The study demonstrates the importance of comparative data analytics to urban and transportation research.},

The NTL intensity is represented as a continuous mathematical surface of human activities, and the elemental features of urban structures are identified by analogy with earth's topography. We use a topographical metaphor of a mount to identify an urban center or subcenter and the surface slope to indicate an urban land-use intensity gradient. An urban center can be defined as a continuous area with higher concentration or density of employments and human activities. We successfully identified 33 urban centers, delimited their corresponding boundaries, and determined their spatial relations for Shanghai metropolitan area, by developing a localized contour tree method. In addition, several useful properties of the urban centers have been derived, such as 9\% of Shanghai administrative area has become urban centers. We believe that this method is applicable to other metropolitan regions at different spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Quantifying urban areas is crucial for addressing associated urban issues such as environmental and sustainable problems. Remote sensing data, especially the nighttime light images, have been widely used to delineate urbanized areas across the world. Meanwhile, some emerging urban data, such as volunteered geographical information (e.g., OpenStreetMap) and social sensing data (e.g., mobile phone and social media), have also shown great potential in revealing urban boundaries and dynamics. However, consistent and robust methods to quantify urban areas from these multi-source data have remained elusive. Here, we propose a percolation-based method to extract urban areas from these multi-source urban data. We derive the optimal urban/non-urban threshold by considering the critical nature of urban systems with the support of the percolation theory. Furthermore, we apply the method with three open-source datasets {\textendash} population, road, and nighttime light {\textendash} to 28 countries. We show that the proposed method captures the similar urban characteristics in terms of urban areas from multi-source data, and Zipf's law holds well in most countries. The accuracy of the derived urban areas by different datasets has been validated with the Landsat-based reference data in 10 cities, and the accuracy can be further improved through data fusion ($\kappa$~=~0.69{\textendash}0.85, mean $\kappa$ = 0.78). Our study not only provides an efficient method to quantify urban areas with open-source data, but also deepens the understanding of urban systems and sheds some light on multi-source data fusion in geographical fields.},

	abstract = {In light of the need for fine-grained, accurate, and timely urban land use information, a per-field classification approach was proposed in this paper to automatically map fine-grained urban land use in a study area within Haidian District, Beijing, China, in 2016. High-resolution remote sensing imagery and multi-source social sensing data were used to provide both physical and socioeconomic information. Four categories of attributes were derived from both data sources for urban land use parcels segmented by the OpenStreetMap road network, including spectral/texture attributes, landscape metrics, Baidu Point-Of-Interest (POI) attributes, and Weibo attributes. The random forests technique was adopted to conduct the classification. The importance of each attribute, attribute category, and data source was evaluated for the classification as a whole and the classification of individual land use types. The results showed that a testing accuracy of 77.83\% can be achieved. The approach is relatively good at classifying open space and residential parcels, and poor at classifying institutional parcels. While using solely remote sensing data or social sensing data can achieve equally high overall accuracy, their importance varies in terms of the classification of individual classes. Landscape metrics are the most important for open space parcels. Spectral/texture attributes are more important in identifying institutional and residential parcels. The classification of business parcels relies more on landscape metrics and social sensing data, and less on spectral/texture attributes. The classification accuracy can be potentially improved upon the acquisition of purer parcels and the addition of new attributes. It is expected that the proposed approach will be useful for the routine update of urban land use information and large-scale urban land use mapping.},

This study converts a typical kind of LBSM data, geo-tagged tweets, into raster images at the 500 m spatial resolution and compares them with the new generation nighttime lights (NTL) image products, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) monthly image composites. The results show that the monthly tweet images are significantly correlated with the VIIRS-DNB images at the pixel level. The tweet images have nearly the same ability on estimating electric power consumption and better performance on assessing personal incomes and population than the NTL images. Tweeted areas (i.e. the pixels with at least one posted tweet) are closer to satellite-derived built-up/urban areas than lit areas in NTL imagery, making tweet images an alternative to delimit extents of human activities. Moreover, the monthly tweet images do not show apparent seasonal changes, and the values of tweet images are more stable across different months than VIIRS-DNB monthly image composites. This study explores the potential of LBSM data at relatively fine spatiotemporal resolutions to estimate or map socioeconomic factors as an alternative to NTL images in the United States.},

However, both the diversity and the complex nonlinear relationships of PM2.5 influencing factors pose challenges for accurate mapping. To address these issues, we innovatively combined social sensing data with remote sensing data and other auxiliary variables, which can bring both natural and social factors into the modeling; meanwhile, we used a deep learning method to learn the nonlinear relationships. The geospatial analysis methods were applied to realize effective feature extraction of the social sensing data and a grid matching process was carried out to integrate the spatiotemporal multi-source heterogeneous data. Based on this research strategy, we finally generated hourly PM2.5 concentration data at a spatial resolution of 0.01{\textdegree}. This method was successfully applied to the central urban area of Wuhan in China, which the optimal result of the 10-fold cross-validation R2 was 0.832. Our work indicated that the real-time check-in and traffic index variables can improve both quantitative and mapping results. The mapping results could be potentially applied for urban environmental monitoring, pollution exposure assessment, and health risk research.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have attempted to disaggregate census data into fine resolution with multisource remote sensing data considering the importance of fine-resolution population distribution in urban planning, environmental protection, resource allocation, and social economy. However, the lack of direct human activity information invariably restricts the accuracy of population mapping and reduces the credibility of the mapping process even when external facility distribution information is adopted. To address these problems, the present study proposed a novel population mapping method by combining International Space Station (ISS) photography nighttime light data, point of interest (POI) data, and location-based social media data. A similarity matching model, consisting of semantic and distance matching models, was established to integrate POI and social media data. Effective information was extracted from the integrated data through principal component analysis and then used along with road density information to train the random forest (RF) model. A comparison with WordPop data proved that our method can generate fine-resolution population distribution with higher accuracy (     R 2  = 0.91    ) than those of previous studies (     R 2  = 0.55    ). To illustrate the advantages of our method, we highlighted the limitations of previous methods that ignore social media data in handling residential regions with similar light intensity. We also discussed the performance of our method in adopting social media data, considering their characteristics, with different volumes and acquisition times. Results showed that social media data acquired between 19:00 and 8:00 with a volume of approximately 300,000 will help our method realize high accuracy with low computation burden. This study showed the great potential of combining social sensing data for disaggregating fine-resolution population.},

Meanwhile, the quantitative evaluation of the suitability of urban residential land is essential for a better and more powerful understanding of urban residential land planning and improvement. Most urban land suitability studies rely solely on remote sensing data and GIS data to evaluate natural suitability, and few studies have focused on urban land suitability from a socioeconomic perspective. Consequently, this paper integrates remote sensing data (GaoFen-2 satellite image) and social sensing data (Tencent User Density data, Point-of-interest data and OpenStreetMap data) to establish an evaluation framework for analyzing the suitability of urban residential land in the Haidian District, Beijing, China, in which, ecological comfortability, locational livability and overall suitability were evaluated according to five attributes extracted from urban residential land via the factor analysis method. The evaluation results of this case study show that, compared with the suburban area in the northwest, the urban area tends to have lower ecological comfortability and higher locational livability. The overall suitability increases from southeast to northwest, consistent with the spatial distribution of ecological comfortability. This framework can potentially assist with the sustainable development of residential lands and urban land use planning.},

This paper integrates socially sensed activity data with a remotely sensed land cover product in order to infer urban land use and its changes over time. We conducted a case study in the Washington D.C.\&ndash;Baltimore metropolitan area to identify the pattern of land use change from undeveloped to developed land, including residential and non-residential uses for a period covering 1986\&ndash;2008. The proposed approach modeled physical and behavioral features of land parcels from a satellite-based impervious surface cover change product and georeferenced Tweets, respectively. A model assessment with random forests classifiers showed that the proposed classification workflow could classify residential and non-residential land uses at an accuracy of 81\%, 4\% better than modeling the same land uses from physical features alone. Using the timestamps of the impervious surface cover change product, the study also reconstructed the timeline of the identified land uses. The results indicated that the proposed approach was capable of mapping detailed land use and change in an urban region, and represents a new and viable way forward for urban land use surveying that could be especially useful for surveying and tracking changes in cities where traditional approaches and mapping products (i.e., from remote sensing products) may have a limited capacity to capture change.},

On the other hand, by studying the distribution of shapes of lots in urban regions, we are able to detect global differences in the spatial structure of the distribution of land. Our findings introduce information about spatial patterns that emerge in the structure of urban settlements; this knowledge is useful for the understanding of urban growth, to improve existing models of cities, in the context of sustainability, in studies about human mobility in urban areas, among other applications.},

The proposed method is adaptable to unify complex factors into one simple form for swift coding, and depends less on observational data to handle data unavailability. In the study area of Beijing, we validate that the measure can infer varied public transport efficiencies and access equalities of different regions.

Exploring POI configurations of urban regions facilitates to understand their functionalities, vibrancy, and developments. However, current studies and applications mainly make statistics toward POI counts on various types separately, neglecting the implicit semantic relations between different types and failing to uncover POI-configuration patterns intuitively. This study proposes a novel framework for visualizing and exploring POIs on POI-type semantic space, with semantic relations of the types being considered. Firstly, using a word-embedding technique (i.e., Word2Vec), the embeddings of POI types are learned from their neighborships on geographic space. Secondly, using a dimension-reduction technique (i.e., t-SNE), all POI-type embeddings are mapped onto 2-dimensional semantic space, where related or similar types would be nearer to each other. Finally, taking the POI-type semantic space as a {\textquotedblleft}base map{\textquotedblright}, POI configuration of each region is rendered as a {\textquotedblleft}thematic map{\textquotedblright} by POI counts on various types, which can help intuitively understand and conveniently compare urban regions.

Generalizing spatial and temporal flow patterns from such data is essential to demonstrate spatial connections and mobility trends. Clustering approaches provide effective methods to handle data sets that contain massive individual-level flows. However, existing flow clustering studies obscure the geometric properties of flow data, such as direction and length, which significantly indicate movement trends. In addition, temporal information is often ignored because previous approaches have mainly focused on the perspective of spatial clusters of flow data, resulting in a loss of temporal patterns. In this paper, we introduce new spatial and temporal similarity measurements between flows and propose a new clustering approach of flow data based on a stepwise strategy. This method can identify clusters from distinct flow distributions and discover significant spatio-temporal trends from large flow data. Simulated experiments with synthetic flows and a case study using Beijing taxi trip data are conducted to validate the usefulness of the proposed method.},

To fill this gap, this study proposes a novel framework for extracting and understanding the cognitive regions of urban metro stations based on points of interest (POIs). First, we extract the cognitive regions of metro stations based on co-occurrence patterns of the stations and their surrounding POIs on web pages by proposing a cohesive approach combined of spatial clustering, web page extraction, knee-point detection, and polygon generation techniques. Second, we identify the semantics of metro stations based on POI types inside the regions using the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method. In total 166 metro stations along with more than one million POIs in Shenzhen, China are utilized as data sources of the case study. The results indicate that our proposed framework can well detect the place characteristics of urban metro stations, which enriches the place-based GIS research and provides a human-centric perspective for urban planning and location-based-service (LBS) applications.},

	abstract = {Traffic forecasting is the task of predicting future traffic based on historical traffic data. It is challenging due to the complex spatial-temporal correlation on road networks. Most existing research works use sequential Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to model traffic inference. However, they only focus on nodes (intersections) or edges (road segments) traffic forecasting alone. As a result, they could hardly provide a complete description of future traffic on road networks. Actually, nodes and edges traffic are interrelated. Both of them are important for traffic safety and efficiency, and neither one is negligible. In this paper, we exploit nodes and edges information together and make traffic forecasting on nodes and edges simultaneously. We propose a novel dual graph framework, called DualGraph, to model the propagation behavior of traffic on road networks. Inside our framework, we develop a DualMap block to simulate the recursive interactions between nodes and edges. The interaction process is realized by a message passing mechanism of nearby information flow. We employ the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) software to generate real-world traffic data to illustrate the effectiveness of our method. We also empirically evaluate our model on public traffic datasets. The results show that even for node or edge traffic forecasting alone, our model still outperforms compared ones, especially for long term (one hour) prediction.},

residual neural networks to model the temporal closeness, period, and trend
properties of the crowd traffic, respectively. For each property, we design a
branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial
properties of the crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the
output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different
weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined
with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the
final traffic of crowds in each and every region. We evaluate ST-ResNet based
on two types of crowd flows in Beijing and NYC, finding that its performance
exceeds six well-know methods.},

Nighttime lighting is a rough proxy for economic wealth, and nighttime maps of the world show that many developing countries are sparsely illuminated. Jean et al. combined nighttime maps with high-resolution daytime satellite images (see the Perspective by Blumenstock). With a bit of machine-learning wizardry, the combined images can be converted into accurate estimates of household consumption and assets, both of which are hard to measure in poorer countries. Furthermore, the night- and day-time data are publicly available and nonproprietary.
Science, this issue p. 790; see also p. 753
Reliable data on economic livelihoods remain scarce in the developing world, hampering efforts to study these outcomes and to design policies that improve them. Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African countries{\textemdash}Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda{\textemdash}we show how a convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can explain up to 75\% of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.

This task is challenging due to the complex spatial and temporal correlations (e.g., the constraints of road network and the law of dynamic change with time). Existing work tried to solve this problem by exploiting a variety of spatiotemporal models. However, we observe that more semantic pair-wise correlations among possibly distant roads are also critical for traffic flow prediction. To jointly model the spatial, temporal, semantic correlations with various global features in the road network, this paper proposes T-MGCN (Temporal Multi-Graph Convolutional Network), a deep learning framework for traffic flow prediction. First, we identify several kinds of semantic correlations, and encode the non-Euclidean spatial correlations and heterogeneous semantic correlations among roads into multiple graphs. These correlations are then modeled by a multi-graph convolutional network. Second, a recurrent neural network is utilized to learn dynamic patterns of traffic flow to capture the temporal correlations. Third, a fully connected neural network is utilized to fuse the spatiotemporal correlations with global features. We evaluate T-MGCN on two real-world traffic datasets and observe improvement by approximately 3\% to 6\% as compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.},

Although mapping the geographies of people flows has attracted a lot of interest across scholarly disciplines, uncovering the spatial-temporal dynamics of daily intercity mobility has been under-researched. This is especially the case where varied travel behaviours occur at different periods, which can be defined as temporal heterogeneity of intercity mobility. This study aims to address this lacuna by examining the varied spatial-temporal dynamics of daily intercity mobility. To be specific, using millions of Tencent location-based service records generated within the Yangtze River Delta, this study maps the spatial network of intercity population movements and reveals how different driving forces shape different intercity travels, in which three types of travel purposes {\textemdash} commutes, business trips, and leisure activities {\textemdash} are assumed to play different roles during weekdays, weekends and national holidays. Employing a multivariate regression quadratic assignment procedure, the results show that (1) the pull-push framework can be adapted to reflect the dynamics of daily mobility, and (2) different types of travels are related to different driving factors, and thus generating varied spatial-temporal patterns of intercity mobilities. This study reveals the temporal heterogeneity of daily intercity mobility, and furthermore enhances our understanding of the geographies of YRD's daily intercity mobility.},

State-of-the-art methods on taxi demand prediction only capture static spatial correlations between regions (e.g., Using static graph embedding) and only take taxi demand data into consideration. We propose a Multi-Task Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (MSTGAT-Net) framework which models the correlations between regions dynamically with graph-attention network and captures the correlation between taxi pick up and taxi drop off with multi-task training.

Yet, the human mobility aspect remains vague in terms of how large crowds come together in the first place. Using high-resolution human mobility data in form of millions, potentially realtime, subway and taxi records, our approach uncovers the mobility patterns involved in large crowd gatherings. In addition, we discriminate anomalous mobility fluxes from ordinary mobility fluxes by introducing the concept of anomalous mobility networks, within which nodes are traffic zones and links are defined via the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our approach allows for easy identification of occurrence, location and developing stages of crowd formation. Strikingly, within the anomalous mobility networks, we find high-stress crowd density to be preceded by a node in-degree kin surpassing the critical threshold kc, typically preceding the maximum crowd density by a couple of hours, enabling us to anticipate large crowd gatherings via a surprisingly simple approach based on the simple network index kin.},

A commonly employed method of defining a metropolitan area is the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), based on rules attempting to capture the notion of city as a functional economic region, and it is performed by using experience. The construction of MSAs is a time-consuming process and is typically done only for a subset (a few hundreds) of the most highly populated cities. Here, we introduce a method to designate metropolitan areas, denoted {\textquotedblleft}City Clustering Algorithm{\textquotedblright} (CCA). The CCA is based on spatial distributions of the population at a fine geographic scale, defining a city beyond the scope of its administrative boundaries. We use the CCA to examine Gibrat's law of proportional growth, which postulates that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate of cities are constant, independent of city size. We find that the mean growth rate of a cluster by utilizing the CCA exhibits deviations from Gibrat's law, and that the standard deviation decreases as a power law with respect to the city size. The CCA allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these deviations, which are shown to arise from the existence of long-range spatial correlations in population growth. These results have sociopolitical implications, for example, for the location of new economic development in cities of varied size.},

	abstract = {Due to the limitation of data collection techniques and privacy issues, the problem of missing spatial origin-destination flows frequently occurs. Data imputation provides great support for the acquisition of complete flow data, which enables us to better understand regional connections and mobility patterns. However, existing models or approaches neglect the network structure of spatial flows, thus resulting in inappropriate estimates and a low performance. The development of graph neural networks offers a powerful tool to deal with graph-structured data. In this article, we proposed a spatial interaction graph convolutional network model, which combines graph convolution and a mapping function to predict flow data from the perspective of network learning. This model utilizes geographical unit embedding in local spatial networks to improve prediction accuracy. A negative sampling technique is adopted to reduce misestimation. Experiments on Beijing taxi trip data verified the usefulness of our model in spatial flow prediction. We also demonstrated that a biased training sample had a negative impact on the model's performance. More attributes of geographical units, a more proper negative sampling rate and a larger training set can increase the prediction accuracy of flow data.},

However, there is no consensus on the distribution below the very upper tail, because available data need to rely on "legal" rather than "economic" definitions for medium and small cities. To remedy this difficulty, we construct cities "from the bottom up" by clustering populated areas obtained from high-resolution data. We find that Zipf's law for population holds for cities as small as 5,000 inhabitants in Great Britain and 12,000 inhabitants in the US. We also find a Zipf's law for areas.

	abstract = {Urban ride-hailing demand prediction is a long-term but challenging task for online car-hailing system decision, taxi scheduling and intelligent transportation construction. Accurate urban ride-hailing demand prediction can improve vehicle utilization and scheduling, reduce waiting time and traffic congestion. Existing traffic flow prediction approaches mainly utilize region-based situation awareness image or station-based graph representation to capture traffic spatial dynamic while we observe that combination of situation awareness image and graph representation are also critical for accurate forecasting. In this paper, we propose the Multiple Spatio-Temporal Information Fusion Networks (MSTIF-Net), a novel deep learning approach to better fuse multiple situation awareness information and graphs representation. MSTIF-Net model integrates structures of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN), Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Sequence to Sequence Learning (Seq2seq) model to obtain the joint latent representation of urban ride-hailing situation that contain both Euclidean spatial features and non-Euclidean structural features, and capture the spatio-temporal dynamics. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world large scale urban traffic datasets and the experimental studies demonstrate MSTIF-Net has achieved superior performance of urban ride-Hailing demand prediction compared with some traditional state-of-art baseline models.},

Both city transportation networks and city economic networks reflect intercity relationships in urban systems from different aspects. Although HSR networks are being developed rapidly worldwide, we still lack a deep understanding on how HSR relates to the economic growth of urban agglomerations from a {\textquotedblleft}double-network{\textquotedblright} perspective. In this research, we first built city HSR networks and city economic networks, respectively, before the QAP method was used to examine their relationship during 2010{\textendash}2015. By analyzing comparatively the differences of the coupling relationship in various areas in China as a typical case, this study contributes to the understanding of the dynamic coupling relationship between new forms of transportation and regional economic development. We found a strong coupling relationship between HSR and economic growth, and HSR tends to play a more prominent role in promoting urban integration and development in areas with more developed economies (coefficients of more developed areas are all above 0.6, while that of less developed areas are below 0.4). Such correlated relationship is more obvious in smaller administrative scopes compared to cross-administrative regions. This study proposed a research framework for {\textquotedblleft}double-network{\textquotedblright} analysis in exploring the relationship between the different networks. It could also provide policy implantation for balanced regional development in emerging economies.},

Previous work has investigated urban functions based on human activities that were derived from mobile phone positioning data, check-in data, taxi data, etc. However, urban functions can only be comprehensively sensed from both human activities and the physical environment together. To do so, a deep learning method was proposed to predict urban functions by integrating social media data and street-level imagery. The verbs extracted from social media posts were taken as the proxy for human activities, and we identified urban physical environmental information from street-level imagery. Then urban functions were uncovered from both the verbs in terms of human activities and street-level imagery from the perspective of the physical environment. Twelve types of urban function were recognized by verbs in social media posts, which were then improved by integrating street-level imagery within the 5th Ring Road of Beijing, China. The experiment demonstrated that verbs as direct proxies for human activities can avoid noise, and the multi-source data integration eliminated biases caused by a single data source. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of urban structure and dynamics for urban management and planning.},

Recently, as the urban population expands, the ways in which humans interact with their surroundings has evolved, presenting a dynamic distribution in space and time locally and frequently. Therefore, how to better understand the local urban environment and differentiate varying preferences for urban areas has been a big challenge for policymakers. This study leverages geotagged Flickr photographs to quantify characteristics of varying urban areas and exploit the dynamics of areas where more people assemble. An advanced image recognition model is used to extract features from large numbers of images in Inner London within the period 2013{\textendash}2015. After the integration of characteristics, a series of visualisation techniques are utilised to explore the characteristic differences and their dynamics. We find that urban areas with higher population densities cover more iconic landmarks and leisure zones, while others are more related to daily life scenes. The dynamic results demonstrate that season determines human preferences for travel modes and activity modes. Our study expands the previous literature on the integration of image recognition method and urban perception analytics and provides new insights for stakeholders, who can use these findings as vital evidence for decision making.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised spatial representation learning aims to automatically identify effective features of geographic entities (i.e., regions) from unlabeled yet structural geographical data. Existing network embedding methods can partially address the problem by: (1) regarding a region as a node in order to reformulate the problem into node embedding; (2) regarding a region as a graph in order to reformulate the problem into graph embedding. However, these studies can be improved by preserving (1) intra-region geographic structures, which are represented by multiple spatial graphs, leading to a reformulation of collective learning from relational graphs; (2) inter-region spatial autocorrelations, which are represented by pairwise graph regularization, leading to a reformulation of adversarial learning. Moreover, field data in real systems are usually lack of labels, an unsupervised fashion helps practical deployments. Along these lines, we develop an unsupervised Collective Graph-regularized dual-Adversarial Learning (CGAL) framework for multi-view graph representation learning and also a Graph-regularized dual-Adversarial Learning (GAL) framework for single-view graph representation learning. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the enhanced effectiveness of our method.},

However, most researches on functional zone division are based on a large spatial scale such as blocks or other scales larger than it. Aiming at a subtle fine functional result, the concept of Super Object (SO) was especially explained, also a Super Object Convolutional Neural Network (SO{\textendash}CNN) based urban functional zone fine division method with very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing image was proposed. The original image was firstly segmented into different SOs which correspond to the basic functional zone units in geography. A random point generation algorithm was used to generate the voting points for functional zone category identification, and then a trained CNN model was employed to assign functional attributes to those voting points. Then a statistical method was involved to count the frequency of the classified voting points of different functional attributes in each basic functional zone units. By voting process, the functional attribute with the highest frequency was assigned to the basic functional zone unit, which corrected the misclassification results of CNN to some extent. This paper also explored the scale effect of the SO on the final functional zone classification result from two aspects, spatial scale of SO and the sampling window size of CNN model. Because of the natural differences between functional zone division and land cover classification, region based overall accuracy assessment method was used to evaluate functional zone division result. Compared with other methods, SO{\textendash}CNN method can generate higher accuracy and subtle result, based on which larger spatial scale results can be available by scaling-up, so SO{\textendash}CNN method plays a great significant role on small scale functional space structure research.},

Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximumly preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work addresses these challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques, and application scenarios.},

Ma{\textquoteright}an Governorate covers approximately 37\% of the total area of Jordan, and consists mostly of uncultivated land 33304.66 km2 (99.49\%). Three main LULC classes were identified of the three years; 1990, 2000 and 2018; forest and irrigated areas have been fluctuated between 86.00 km2 (0.26\%), 108.06 km2 (0.32) and 102.68 km2 (0.31\%), built-up area increased by 24.00 km2, (0.07\%), 41.88 km2 (0.13\%) and 68.66 km2 (0.21\%), while the bare land has been decreased from 33366 km2 (99.67\%),33476 km2 (99.55\%) and 33304.66 km2 (99.49\%) during 1990, 2000 and 2018 respectively. land suitability for the agricultural use (rainfed areas and irrigated crops); Data from the five parameters (mentioned above) are used for spatial analysis applying weighted overlay method. The results showed that only about (0.2\%) from the total area of Ma{\textquoteright}an is highly suitable for agriculture dependent on rainfall. While about (1.4\%) is high suitable for the irrigation crops. The main reason of the low levels of land suitability for agriculture is very low soil fertility, and the water scarcity.},

	abstract = {Integrating social demands into landscape management has been proven difficult because of a lack of suitable measures. In order to address this issue this article describes the development of the Index of Function Suitability (IFS). This offers an integrated conceptual tool for incorporating social demands into landscape management. The IFS links preferences to land cover spatial patterns as it uses quantitative indicators for gauging differences between the preferred landscape patterns by users, for a certain activity related to an amenity function (e.g. hunting), and the land cover patterns of a given rural area (either at the present or from scenarios developed for the future). Introducing the measurement of the difference between the preferred spatial patterns and the landscape patterns occurring in a given landscape is a fundamental conceptual development represented in the IFS. By using the same set of indicators to quantify different land cover patterns, the IFS gauges quantitatively the differences between their spatial patterns, thus providing landscape managers with an indication of the suitability of changing land covers to support the selected amenity functions. In this paper, the conceptual aspects, as well as the methodological steps of the IFS were explained and further applied to one empirical case study in the Alentejo region of Portugal. This paper also examines both the strengths and weaknesses of the IFS approach along with a discussion for improvement.},

The performance of the SLEUTH-Suitability version has been quantified in terms of relative improvement in the best fit value of the Optimal SLEUTH Metric (OSM), spatial and statistical measures while simulating urban growth of Ajmer City in the Rajasthan state of India as compared to existing SLEUTH version. Both versions i.e., SLEUTH and SLEUTH-Suitability models were parameterized and calibrated using a required dataset of 05~years over a period of 18~years i.e., 1997, 2000, 2008, 2013, and 2015. Performance of the SLEUTH-Suitability has been found to be better in terms of improved calibration as indicated by better OSM values and improved capturing of different urban growth forms like fragmented and scattered growth. Furthermore, using the SLEUTH-Suitability, urban growth is forecasted up to the year 2040 in Ajmer city to understand the growth pattern.},

	abstract = {The prosperity of ride-sharing services has rippled in the communities of GIScience, transportation, and urban planning. Meanwhile, road network structure has been analyzed from a network science perspective that focuses on nodes and relational links and aims to predictive models. However, limited empirical studies have explored the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility through such perspective. This paper utilizes the spatial Durbin model to understand the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility, proxied by Uber accessibility, through classical network measures of degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Taking the city of Atlanta as a case study, we have found in addition to population density and road network density, larger values of degree centrality and smaller values of closeness centrality of the road network are associated with better accessibility of Uber services. However, the effects of betweenness centrality are not significant. Furthermore, we have revealed heterogeneous effects of degree centrality and closeness centrality on the accessibility of Uber services, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by different time windows (i.e., weekday vs. weekend, rush hour in the morning vs. evening). Network science provides us both conceptual and methodological measures to understand the association between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility. In this study, we constructed road network structure measures with OpenStreetMap, which is reproducible, replicable, and scalable because of its global coverage and public availability. The study resonates with the notion of cities as the set of interactions across networks, as we have observed time-sensitive heterogeneous effects of road network structure on ride-sharing accessibility.},

	abstract = {Many studies are in an effort to explore urban spatial structure, and urban functional regions have become the subject of increasing attention among planners, engineers and public officials. Attempts have been made to identify urban functional regions using high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images and extensive geo-data. However, the research scale and throughput have also been limited by the accessibility of HSR remote sensing data. Recently, big geo-data are becoming increasingly popular for urban studies since research is still accessible and objective with regard to the use of these data. This study aims to build a novel framework to provide an alternative solution for sensing urban spatial structure and discovering urban functional regions based on emerging geo-data {\textendash} points of interest (POIs) data and an embedding learning method in the natural language processing (NLP) field. We started by constructing the intraurban functional corpus using a center-context pairs-based approach. A word embeddings representation model for training that corpus was used to extract multiprototype vectors in the second step, and the last step aggregated the functional parcels based on an introduced spatial clustering method, hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). The clustering results suggested that our proposed framework used in this study is capable of discovering the utilization of urban space with a reasonable level of accuracy. The limitation and potential improvement of the proposed framework are also discussed.},

The city center will promote the development of the central area in this city, and the more urban centers are distributed within the geographical and spatial range, the greater contribution would have to economic development.

	abstract = {In the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns have succeeded in limiting contagions in many countries, at however heavy societal costs: more targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions are desirable to contain or mitigate potential resurgences. Contact tracing, by identifying and quarantining people who have been in prolonged contact with an infectious individual, has the potential to stop the spread where and when it occurs, with thus limited impact. The limitations of manual contact tracing (MCT), due to delays and imperfect recall of contacts, might be compensated by digital contact tracing (DCT) based on smartphone apps, whose impact however depends on the app adoption. To assess the efficiency of such interventions in realistic settings, we use here datasets describing contacts between individuals in several contexts, with high spatial and temporal resolution, to feed numerical simulations of a compartmental model for COVID-19. We find that the obtained reduction of epidemic size has a robust behavior: this benefit is linear in the fraction of contacts recalled during MCT, and quadratic in the app adoption, with no threshold effect. The combination of tracing strategies can yield important benefits, and the cost (number of quarantines) vs. benefit curve has a typical parabolic shape, independent on the type of tracing, with a high benefit and low cost if app adoption and MCT efficiency are high enough. Our numerical results are qualitatively confirmed by analytical results on simplified models. These results may inform the inclusion of MCT and DCT within COVID-19 response plans.},

Today, the model is predominantly invoked and applied in the context of {\textquoteleft}transit-oriented development{\textquoteright} planning debates. As a corollary, these model applications share the pursuit of supporting a transition towards increased rail ridership (and walking and cycling), and therefore assumingly a transition to more sustainable travel behavior. Surprisingly, analyses of the importance of node and place interventions in explaining rail ridership remain thin on the ground. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to integrate the node-place model approach with current insights that derive from the trip end modeling literature. To this end, we apply a series of regression analyses in order to appraise the most important explanatory factors that impact rail ridership in Flanders, Belgium, today. This appraisal is based on both geographical and temporal data segmentations, in order to test for different types of railway stations and for different periods of the day. Additionally, we explore spatial nonstationarity by calibrating geographically weighted regression models, and this for different time windows. The models developed should allow policy and planning professionals to investigate the possible demand impacts of changes to existing stations and the walkable area surrounding them.},

The results are, however, typically too general to provide adequate policy recommendations for planners and researchers. The stages between creating a plan and its outcome are seldom discussed in detail, primarily because of the absence of an applicable analytic framework and data. In the paper, we propose a framework for UPI evaluation from spatial dimension which provides an in-depth and accurate application to show how the conceptual framework can be applied for assessing conformance and performance (sequential conformance) of plans proposed by Hopkins (2012) could be applied in practice. We examined the degrees of conformance and sequential conformance between an urban master plan, detailed plans, development permits and observed development outcomes, using Beijing as an example. The results reveal discrepancies between all basic stages of plan implementation, and the poor planning implementation was primarily due to the existence of large areas of development without development permits. These results suggest that the poor match between a plan and its outcomes may result from poor plan using, not poor planning. Therefore, attention needs to be paid not only to creating plans but also to monitoring the performance of various levels of plans and development permits in the UPI.},

	abstract = {The biased population coverage and short temporal lengths of newly emerged data sets (e.g., data sets of social media, mobile phones, and smart cards) obstruct the effective analysis of long-term dynamics of landuse patterns, particularly in small and developing cities. This study proposed a framework to delineate and analyze mixed land-use patterns and their evolution using municipal water consumption data. A two-step classification strategy was designed based on the rotation forest scheme to differentiate the socioeconomic types of customers (e.g., residence, commerce, public facility, manufacturing, and recreation) using multiple features extracted from the various forms of water consumption time series. The spatial distributions of the socioeconomic functions were then derived, and the mixed land use was measured using a diversity index based on information entropy. Such an approach was applied to Changshu, a typical developing county-level city in China, for the period 2004 to 2013. The results showed that the urbanization of Changshu experienced both spatial expansion and intensification, with a slightly declining rate of growth in recent years. Apart from the city center, two subcenters have emerged for industrial development. The degree of land-use mixture has increased with urban growth, indicating a maturing of urbanization. This study explored the approach of identifying individual socioeconomic functions by the consumption patterns of municipal services and demonstrated that municipal service data sets can reveal land-use patterns and dynamics at a fine spatial resolution to evaluate urban planning and management, with the advantages of large population coverage and long-term temporal lengths.},

The report does not aim at a fully comprehensive synopsis of work done under the rubric of {\textquotedblleft}urban science{\textquotedblright} but it does aim to convey what makes urban science different from discipline-based examinations of cities and urbanization. It also highlights novel insights generated by the inherently multidisciplinary inquiry that urban science exemplifies. The authors of the report are all based in academic or research institutions but several of them are close to practice by virtue of collaboration with NGOs and community groups and engagement with policy. The authors also represent different academic disciplines and varied traditions of scientific inquiry. The report is meant to facilitate, and hopefully also provoke, discussion among the many stakeholders for whom a scientifically based, empirically rich, and historically deep understanding of cities and urbanization is not only intellectually compelling but also socially urgent and ethically pressing.

It is not an easy task due to spectral heterogeneity and structural diversity of the complex backgrounds. In this paper, an object-based multi-modal convolution neural networks (OMM-CNN) is proposed for building extraction using panchromatic and multispectral imagery. Specifically, a multi-modal deep CNN (the multispectral CNN and the panchromatic CNN) architecture is designed which can mine multiscale spectral-spatial contextual information. In order to fully explore the spatial-spectral information embedded in panchromatic and multispectral images, the complex convolution and complex self-adaption pooling layer are developed. Furthermore, to improve the building extraction accuracy and efficiency, a simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) algorithm is used to segment the panchromatic and multispectral remote sensing imagery simultaneous. Results demonstrated that the proposed method can extract different types of buildings, and the result is more accurate and effective than that of the recent building extraction methods.},

The ten most innovative cities in the United States account for 23\% of the national population, but for 48\% of its patents and 33\% of its gross domestic product. But why has human activity become increasingly concentrated? Here we use data on scientific papers, patents, employment and gross domestic product, for 353 metropolitan areas in the United States, to show that the spatial concentration of productive activities increases with their complexity. Complex economic activities, such as biotechnology, neurobiology and semiconductors, concentrate disproportionately in a few large cities compared to less--complex activities, such as apparel or paper manufacturing. We use multiple proxies to measure the complexity of activities, finding that complexity explains from 40\% to 80\% of the variance in urban concentration of occupations, industries, scientific fields and technologies. Using historical patent data, we show that the spatial concentration of cutting-edge technologies has increased since 1850, suggesting a reinforcing cycle between the increase in the complexity of activities and urbanization. These findings suggest that the growth of spatial inequality may be connected to the increasing complexity of the economy.},

	abstract = {The formulation of mixed urban land uses is not only intended to find the ideal scenario of land use but also regarded as a way toward sustainable urban development. We propose a geo-semantic mining approach Traj2Vec to quantify the trajectories of residents as high-dimensional semantic vectors. Then, a random forest (RF) method is used to model the relationship between the semantic vectors and mixed urban land uses. The proposed Traj2Vec approach can obtain the highest accuracy (OA = 0.7733, kappa = 0.7245) in urban land-use classification and a high average proportion accuracy (64.0\%) in capturing the proportions of urban land-use types. Diversity analysis indicates that Shenzhen has a high degree of mixed urban land use at the scale of a street block. By analyzing the mixing index and the travel distance, we find a weak but significant negative correlation between them (r=-0.107, p{\textless}0.001), which not only confirms the conclusion that an increase in the degree of mixing will reduce the travel distances of residents but also verifies the mixing index. This suggests that urban planning should focus on mixed urban land uses, which can reduce the travel distances of residents, reduce energy consumption, and make cities more compact.},

	abstract = {Research on economic complexity has shown that a country{\textquoteright}s type of exports conditions its future path of economic diversification and economic growth. Yet little emphasis has been put on the inequality associated with the types of products traded between countries and different regions of the world. Here we analyze the income inequality associated with the imports and exports of 116 countries in the period from 1970 to 2010. Our analysis shows that methods from network science and visual complexity research can help to reevaluate old theories in economics, such as core-periphery structures in international trade or structural development traps. Our results illustrate that the core-periphery structure of global trade affects not only the income inequality between countries, but also the income inequality within countries. Moreover, they reveal the structural constraints that developing and emerging economies face in promoting inclusive growth and benchmark their productive transformations with cases of successful catching up and developed economies. The results show that countries, such as South Korea or Germany, have benefited from outsourcing high inequality products. In contrast, some middle-income countries, such as Brazil or South Africa, face structural development constraints consisting of a large average distance of their export products to low inequality products and a {\textquotedblleft}gravitational force{\textquotedblright} towards high inequality products. Finally, developing economies, such as Nicaragua or Sri Lanka face a double development trap for inclusive growth, as their economies depend on both a large share of high inequality exports and imports.},

Utilizing a large-scale dataset which includes 3.5 billion entry and exit records of vehicles along highways generated from toll collection systems, we attempt to establish the relevance of mid-distance land transport patterns to regional economic status through transportation network analyses. We apply standard measurements of complex networks to analyze the highway transportation networks. A set of traffic flow features are computed and correlated to the regional economic development indicator. The multi-linear regression models explain about 89\% to 96\% of the variation of cities{\textquoteright} GDP across three provinces in China. We then fit gravity models using annual traffic volumes of cars, buses, and freight trucks between pairs of cities for each province separately as well as for the whole dataset. We find the temporal changes of distance-decay effects on spatial interactions between cities in transportation networks, which link to the economic development patterns of each province. We conclude that transportation big data reveal the status of regional economic development and contain valuable information of human mobility, production linkages, and logistics for regional management and planning. Our research offers insights into the investigation of regional economic development status using highway transportation big data.},

	abstract = {Urban functional zones (UFZs) are important for urban sustainability and urban planning and management, but UFZ maps are rarely available and up-to-date in developing countries due to frequent economic and human activities and rapid changes in UFZs. Current methods have focused on mapping UFZs in a small area with either remote sensing images or open social data, but large-scale UFZ mapping integrating these two types of data is still not be applied. In this study, a novel approach to mapping large-scale UFZs by integrating remote sensing images (RSIs) and open social data is proposed. First, a context-enabled image segmentation method is improved to generate UFZ units by incorporating road vectors. Second, the segmented UFZs are classified by coupling Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In the classification framework, physical features from RSIs and social attributes from POI (Point of Interest) data are integrated. A case study of Beijing was performed to evaluate the proposed method, and an overall accuracy of 85.9\% was achieved. The experimental results demonstrate that the presented method can provide fine-grained UFZs, and the fusion strategy of RSIs and POI data can distinguish urban functions accurately. The proposed method appears to be promising and practical for large-scale UFZ mapping.},

To prevent incongruous land development, a seamless land use control planning tool, impowered by a decision support system is an imperative part of development management. This study focuses on evaluating the suitability of existing land uses through a spatial decision support system. Although the problem involves various criteria as well as expert judgments, we dealt with a multi-criteria group decision making problem. The proposed methodology consists of two main sections: density-based induced ordered weighted averaging (D-IOWA) operator as a group decision making section to combine expert opinions on the problem, and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy resonance system (ANFIS) to define the compatibility of the land uses in their surrounding environment. Expert opinions were aggregated by the D-IOWA operator and the ANFIS model was trained and then applied to the rest of the data to generate the compatibility map of the residential areas. An accuracy of 81\%, and a root mean square error of 0.44 were observed. Maximum 15\% variation in the outputs was observed in the sensitivity analysis. In addition to the performance measurements of the model, some other models were implemented and compared with the ANFIS model. The comparisons concluded that most of the models provided acceptable accuracies while the ANFIS model acquired the best results and confirmed to be used in similar circumstances. This study confirmed that a multi-criteria decision-making system supported by an accurate classification system can provide a basis for a detailed and accurate distribution of land use across the land unit.},

Discovering these unassuming places (e.g. restaurants) of a city will benefit the understanding of local culture and help to build livable neighborhoods. Previous work has been limited by the lack of appropriate data sources and efficient tools to evaluate the popularity, ambiance and physical surroundings of places in large-scale urban areas. In addition, how to characterize places with respect to different groups of people remains unclear. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach using social media check-ins and street-level images to compare the different activity patterns of visitors and locals, and uncover inconspicuous but interesting places for them in a city. We use check-in records as a proxy of the popularity of a particular type of place, and differentiate visitors and locals based on their travel and social media behaviors. In addition, we employ street-level images to represent the physical environments of places. As a result, we discovered a number of inconspicuous yet popular restaurants in Beijing. These restaurants are located mostly in deep alleys of Old Beijing neighborhoods, where the physical environments are not particularly appealing; however, these places are frequently visited by locals for social engagements. We also discovered beautiful but unpopular outdoor places in Beijing. These places are potential recreational areas for all groups of people and could be improved regarding urban design and planning to make these public infrastructures more attractive. This work demonstrates how multi-source big geo-data can be combined to build comprehensive place-based representations for different groups of people.},

While previous studies focus mainly on inferring urban function types, there are few understandings of how urban functions organize spatially from the perspective of spatial co-occurrence of activities. To address this issue, we propose a new method to mine the co-location patterns (CPs) of urban activities with {\textquoteleft}Point-of-Interest{\textquoteright} (POI) data. We implement a comparative analysis with 25 major cities in China to recognize their commonness/distinctiveness in the spatial organization of urban functions. We identify nearly a thousand unique POI CPs for these cities. By aggregating the resulting CPs, we create the urban function graphs for each city to reflect the inter-connections of different function types. Most cities have relatively high graph densities, suggesting the mixture of urban functions in the space. Despite the relatively similar structures among cities, their manifestations of POI CPs vary greatly from one city to another. The commonly found POI CPs (witnessed in at least 20 cities) only contributes to 6.2\% of the total unique POI CPs. The cities of Wuxi, Chengdu, Ningbo, Shenzhen and Chongqing have most distinctive urban functional structures compared to other cities.},

	abstract = {The grouping of parcel data based on proximity is a pre-processing step of GIS and a key link of urban structure recognition for regional function discovery and urban planning. Currently, most literature abstracts parcels into points and clusters parcels based on their attribute similarity, which produces a large number of coarse granularity functional regions or discrete distribution of parcels that is inconsistent with human cognition. In this paper, we propose a novel parcel grouping method to optimise this issue, which considers both the urban morphology and the urban functional connectivity. Infiltration behaviours of urban components provide a basis for exploring the correlation between morphology mechanism and functional connectivity of urban areas. We measured the infiltration behaviours among adjacent parcels and concluded that the occurrence of infiltration behaviours often appears in the form of groups, which indicated the practical significance of parcel grouping. Our method employed two parcel morphology indicators: the similarity of the line segments and the compactness of the distribution. The line segment similarity was used to establish the adjacent relationship among parcels and the compactness was used to optimise the grouping result in obtain a satisfactory visual expression. In our study, constrained Delaunay triangulation, Hausdorff distance, and graph theory were employed to construct the proximity, delineate the parcel adjacency matrix, and implement the grouping of parcels. We applied this method for grouping urban parcel data of Beijing and verified the rationality of grouping results based on the quantified results of infiltration behaviours. Our method proved to take a good account of infiltration behaviours and satisfied human cognition, compared with a k-means++ method. We also presented a case using Xicheng District in Beijing to demonstrate the practicability of the method. The result showed that our method obtained fine-grained groups while ensuring functional regions-integrity.},

While previous studies have solely focused on delineating regions by urban morphology or deriving functional types from human activities, the sufficient depiction and integration of these characteristics are seldom discussed. This paper inherently considers both urban morphology and human activities to classify urban functional regions. Building-based and region-based landscape metrics derived from building-level blocks are delineated to measure urban morphology, while socioeconomic features are extracted from crowdsourced data related to human activities using a topic model and semantic scaling method. These characteristics are then fused by applying random forest to measure different functions. This approach is tested in Futian district, Shenzhen, Guangdong. The result shows an overall classification accuracy of 0.818, approximately 0.15 higher than that utilising only landscape metrics or only socioeconomic features. This result indicates the effectiveness of the delineated characteristics to depict urban landscapes and socioeconomic information and the reliability of integrating these features for urban functional region classification.},

The results indicated that the CNN-VCA model can effectively uncover the neighborhood effects of multiple driving factors on the developmental potential of land parcels and obtain more details on the morphological characteristics of land parcels.

It is traditionally performed with field surveys or manual photo interpretation, two practices that are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, we aim to automate landuse mapping at the urban-object level with a deep learning approach based on data from multiple sources (or modalities). We consider two image modalities: overhead imagery from Google Maps and ensembles of ground-based pictures (side-views) per urban-object from Google Street View (GSV). These modalities bring complementary visual information pertaining to the urban-objects. We propose an end-to-end trainable model, which uses OpenStreetMap annotations as labels. The model can accommodate a variable number of GSV pictures for the ground-based branch and can also function in the absence of ground pictures at prediction time. We test the effectiveness of our model over the area of {\^I}le-de-France, France, and test its generalization abilities on a set of urban-objects from the city of Nantes, France. Our proposed multimodal Convolutional Neural Network achieves considerably higher accuracies than methods that use a single image modality, making it suitable for automatic landuse map updates. Additionally, our approach could be easily scaled to multiple cities, because it is based on data sources available for many cities worldwide.},

	abstract = {The actual functions of a region may not reflect the intent of the original zoning scheme from planners. To identify the actual urban functional regions, numerous methods have been proposed with computational advancement. Specifically, remote sensing by image recognition, geodemographic classification, social sensing with big data and geo-text mining techniques have been widely applied. Points-of-interest (POIs) are one of the most common open-access data type used to extract information pertaining to functional zones. However, previous works have either lost sight or did not make full use of the spatial interactions that can be extracted from POIs due to model limitations in the context of geographical space. In this research, we introduced an approach that detects functional regions at the scale of a neighborhood area (NA) by combining POI data and a simplified Place2vec model, which is theorized from the first law of geography. First, the POI-based spatial context is constructed by using the nearest neighbor approach. Then, we can increase the number of training tuples (tcenter,tcontext) based on the weight derived from the distance between the POI tcenter and POI tcontext. Next, high-dimensional characteristic vectors of the POIs are extracted by using the skip-gram training framework. By summarizing the POI vectors at the NA level, we employ a K-means clustering model to cluster the functional regions. Compared with other probabilistic topic models (PTMs) and Word2vec, the Place2vec-based approach obtained the highest mean reciprocal rank value (MRR-SWP=0.356, MRR-SLC=0.401, MRR-SJC=0.433, and MRR-SLin=0.421) in terms of similarity capturing performance and functional region identification accuracy (OA=0.7424).

Remote sensing technique and neural network, are two practical tools widely utilized in urban LULC change prediction. Because of the rapid improvement of remote sensing technique, urban data can be periodically captured in a short time interval. A large amount of data cause the conventional neural networks method having bad efficiency in dealing with it.

Deep learning long short term memory neural network, which is an advanced model of recurrent neural network and has a strong ability in dealing with sequence data, is utilized to urban LULC change prediction. Remote sensing data captured from 1984 to 2016 are utilized to conduct experiments.

	abstract = {The relative motion of moving objects is an essential research topic in geographical information science (GIScience), which supports the innovation of geodatabases, spatial indexing, and geospatial services. This analysis is very popular in the domains of urban governance, transportation engineering, logistics and geospatial information services for individuals or industrials. Importantly, data models of moving objects are one of the most crucial approaches to support the analysis for dynamic relative motion between moving objects, even in the age of big data and cloud computing. Traditional geographic information systems (GIS) usually organize moving objects as point objects in absolute coordinated space. The derivation of relative motions among moving objects is not efficient because of the additional geo-computation of transformation between absolute space and relative space. Therefore, current GISs require an innovative approach to directly store, analyze and interpret the relative relationships of moving objects to support their efficient analysis. This paper proposes a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) to construct, operate and analyze moving objects{\textquoteright} relationships and introduces two algorithms (relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching) to derive and analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects. Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The experimental results indicates the execution times of the proposed model are approximately 5{\textendash}50\% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function of these three scenarios. It{\textquoteright}s better computational performance of the proposed model when analyzing the relative relationships of moving objects than the absolute methods in a famous commercial GIS software based on this experimental results. The proposed approach fills the gap of traditional GIS and shows promise for relative space-based geo-computation, analysis and service.},

In this article, we examine the budgeted learning problem for spatial data within the urban context. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel approach for inferring the attributes of spatial data when the data for the model is budgeted. This is achieved using urban functions - which describe the designated use of a geographical space - to infer the types of streets in a city. We evaluated the approach by comparing the performance of the model using the data in each urban function (the budget) against the results from the aggregate of all the functions (all data). The results indicate that with our model, individual urban functions are sufficient to infer the type attributes of streets.},

	abstract = {Landscape patterns and building functions are successfully used to provide the social sensing information of urban areas. However, previous studies treated ground objects equally, ignoring their size differences. Considering the different contributions of various types of ground objects in land-use classification, this paper measured nine area-weighted mean landscape-level metrics to describe landscape patterns based on the land-cover map, derived from remote sensing images. Additionally, the same idea was applied for identifying building functions. Impervious surfaces, which occupy the majority of urban areas, have a decisive impact on land-use classes. In terms of this, this paper proposed the impervious surface area-weighted building-based indexes from the building outline data. To better represent the physical structure of urban areas, the entire study was based on the analysis units delineated by the OpenStreetMap road network. Finally, a random forest model combining the landscape-level metrics and building-based indexes was adopted in Wuchang District of Wuhan city, China. The results showed that the proposed method was effective at describing landscape patterns and identifying building functions for accurate urban land-use classification, increasing the precision by 10.67\%. In general, the contribution of landscape-level metrics to the urban land-use classification is slightly greater than that of building-based indexes. Moreover, different land-use types of analysis units express different landscape patterns. It is of great significance for improving urban form and guiding future urban design. The paper demonstrates that area-weighted landscape metrics and building-based indexes offer a better understanding of urban land use, which plays a vital role in urban planning, construction, and management.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of data in the urban context (e.g., mobile phone, smart card and social media data) allows us to study urban dynamics at much finer temporal resolutions (e.g., diurnal urban dynamics). Mobile phone data, for instance, are found to be a useful data source for extracting diurnal human mobility patterns and for understanding urban dynamics. While previous studies often use call detail record (CDR) data, this study deploys aggregated network-driven mobile phone data that may reveal human mobility patterns more comprehensively and can mitigate some of the privacy concerns raised by mobile phone data usage. We first propose an analytical framework for characterizing and classifying urban areas based on their temporal activity patterns extracted from mobile phone data. Specifically, urban areas{\textquoteright} diurnal spatiotemporal signatures of human mobility patterns are obtained through longitudinal mobile phone data. Urban areas are then classified based on the obtained signatures. The classification provides insights into city planning and development. Using the proposed framework, a case study was implemented in the city of Wuhu, China to understand its urban dynamics. The empirical study suggests that human activities in the city of Wuhu are highly concentrated at the Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) level. This large portion of local activities suggests that development and planning strategies that are different from those used by metropolitan Chinese cities should be applied in the city of Wuhu. This article concludes with discussions on several common challenges associated with using network-driven mobile phone data, which should be addressed in future studies.},

These improvements are applicable for individual users, service providers and decision-makers. People, vehicles and goods move along the city according to the physical resources (roads, bike-lanes, side-walks...) and non-physical resources (such as scheduled public transportation services). We present this set of resources as the Urban Movement Space (UMS). We collect the main challenges and research foundations that geoinformatic approaches need to cope when tackling transportation resources and mobility data. The work presented in this paper proposes a conceptual modelling framework to represent the urban movement space, in order to match observed tracking data accordingly, and allow further analytical queries. Our approach combines an open free-space and network-based space to model the time-varying urban movement space, considering seasonality and uncertainty of multimodal travel options.},

	abstract = {Urban and regional research is crucial for many applications such as public participation, land use, disaster management, and environmental monitoring, but it is a time-consuming and expensive procedure to collect necessary data. Remote sensing is an effective technology for urban observation, however, the spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of observation sensors limits many situations in which remote sensing data cannot be fully utilized, especially in the field of urban observation. Recently, with the popularity of internet and smart mobile devices, social media containing spatial information is evolving rapidly, such as tweets, Flickr photos, and geolocated posts. These location-based social media data are leading new research areas, new technologies and methods, and new insights into urban observation. In this paper, we provide an overview on the integration and joint analysis of remote sensing and social media data in urban observation applications. We describe four opportunities in exploiting social media data: to investigate the relationship among humans, environment and urban, to help urban planning, to manage urban disaster, and to monitor urban environment. Although significant possibilities for a combination of remote sensing and social media data can be seen, our survey suggests that the fusion of these data sources will continue to profoundly change these technologies.},

Using high-resolution data from OpenStreetMap and a satellite-derived time series of urbanization, we compute and validate changes over time in multidimensional street connectivity measures based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. We report on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975 in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi), based on every mapped node and edge in the world. Streets in new developments in 90\% of the 134 most populous countries have become less connected since 1975, while just 29\% show an improving trend since 2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the relative frequency of a street-network type characterized by high circuity, typical of gated communities. We identify persistence in street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent processes. Specifically, cities and countries with low connectivity in recent years also had relatively low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time period. We discuss implications for policy intervention in road building in new and expanding cities as a top priority for sustainable urban development.},

	abstract = {The problem of discovering regions that support particular functionalities in an urban setting has been approached in literature using two general methodologies: top-down, encoding expert knowledge on urban planning and design and discovering regions that conform to that knowledge; and bottom-up, using data to train machine learning models, which can discover similar regions. Both methodologies face limitations, with knowledge-based approaches being criticized for scalability and transferability issues and data-driven approaches for lacking interpretability and depending heavily on data quality. To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose a novel framework that fuses a knowledge-based approach using design patterns and a data-driven approach using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling in three different ways: Functional regions discovered using either approach are evaluated against each other to identify cases of significant agreement or disagreement; knowledge from patterns is used to adjust topic probabilities in the learning model; and topic probabilities are used to adjust pattern-based results. The proposed methodologies are demonstrated through the use case of identifying shopping-related regions in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results show that the combination of pattern-based discovery and topic modeling extraction helps uncover discrepancies between the two approaches and smooth inaccuracies caused by the limitations of each approach.},

These systems typically rest on the concepts of objects and fields, both bound to coordinates, as two general paradigms of geographic representation. The match between notions of place occurring in everyday where questions and the data available to answer such questions is unclear and hinders progress in place-based information systems. This is particularly true in novel application areas such as the Digital Humanities or speech-based human{\textendash}computer interaction, but also for location-based services. Although this shortcoming has been observed before, we approach the challenges of relating places to information system representations with a fresh view, based on a set of core concepts of spatial information. These concepts have been proposed in information science with the intent of serving human{\textendash}machine spatial question asking and answering. Clarifying the relationship of the notion of place to these concepts is a significant step toward geographically intelligent systems. The main result of the article is a demonstration that the notion of place fits existing concepts of spatial information, when these are adequately exploited and combined.},

To concentrate topologically densely connected road segments, communities of urban roads provide a new perspective to study the structure of the network.

The results demonstrate that the distribution of communities at different levels in Guangzhou, China reflects the urban spatial relation between the suburbs and urban centers and within urban centers. Moreover, the study explored the functional area characteristics at the community scale and identified the distribution of various functional areas. Owing to the structure information contained in the identification process, the detected community can be used as a basic unit in other urban studies. In general, with the community-based network, this study proposes a novel method of combining city roads with urban space and functional zones, providing necessary data support and academic guidance for government and urban planners.},

	abstract = {A long-standing question in GIScience is whether geographic information systems (GIS) facilitates an adequate quantifiable representation of the concept of place. Considering the difficulties of quantifying elusive concepts related to place, several researchers focus on more tangible dimensions of the human understanding of place. The most common approaches are semantic enrichment of spatial information and holistic conceptualization of the notion of place. However, these approaches give emphasis on either space or human meaning, or they mainly exist as concepts without practically proven usable artifacts. A partial answer to this problem was proposed by the function-based model that treats place as functional space. This paper focuses primarily on the level of composition, describing and formalizing it as a rule-based framework with the following objectives: (a) contribute to the formalization efforts of the notion of place and its integration within GIS and (b) maintain tangible properties intertwined with the human understanding of place. The operationalization potential of the proposed framework is illustrated with an example of identifying the shopping areas in an urban region. The results show that the proposed model is able to capture all shopping malls as well as other areas that are not explicitly labeled as such but still function similarly to a shopping mall.},

In this study a novel framework for extracting human emotions from large-scale georeferenced photos at different places is proposed. After the construction of places based on spatial clustering of user-generated footprints collected from social media websites, online cognitive services are utilized to extract human emotions from facial expressions using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. Two happiness metrics are defined for measuring the human emotions at different places. To validate the feasibility of the framework, we take 80 tourist attractions around the world as an example and a happiness ranking list of places is generated based on human emotions calculated over 2 million faces detected from greater than 6 million photos. Different kinds of geographical contexts are taken into consideration to find out the relationship between human emotions and environmental factors. Results show that much of the emotional variation at different places can be explained by a few factors such as openness. The research offers insights into integrating human emotions to enrich the understanding of sense of place in geography and in place-based GIS.},

	abstract = {Legibility is the extent to which space can be easily recognized. Evaluating legibility is particularly desirable in indoor spaces, since it has a large impact on human behavior and the efficiency of space utilization. However, indoor space legibility has only been studied through survey and trivial simulations and lacks scalable quantitative measurement. We utilized a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), which is structurally similar to a human perception system, to model legibility in indoor spaces. To implement the modelling of legibility for any indoor space, we designed an end-to-end processing pipeline from indoor data retrieving to model training to spatial legibility analysis. Although the model performed very well (98\% accuracy) overall, there are still discrepancies in model's recognizing confidence among different spaces, reflecting legibility differences. To prove the validity of the pipeline, we deployed a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk, collecting 4015 samples. Meanwhile, we also conducted an identical survey, collecting 570 samples, on occupants in the station. The human samples showed a similar behavior pattern and mechanism as the DCNN models. Further, we used model results to visually explain legibility differences resulting from architectural program, building age, building style, as well as identify visual clusterings of spaces.},

However, previous studies have been limited by the lack of adequate data and efficient methods to quantify the visual aspects of a place. This work proposes a data-driven framework to explore the place-informative scenes and objects by employing deep convolutional neural network to learn and measure the visual knowledge of place appearance automatically from a massive dataset of photos and imagery. Based on the proposed framework, we compare the visual similarity and visual distinctiveness of 18 cities worldwide using millions of geo-tagged photos obtained from social media. As a result, we identify the visual cues of each city that distinguish that city from others: other than landmarks, a large number of historical architecture, religious sites, unique urban scenes, along with some unusual natural landscapes have been identified as the most place-informative elements. In terms of the city-informative objects, taking vehicles as an example, we find that the taxis, police cars and ambulances are the most place-informative objects. The results of this work are inspiring for various fields{\textemdash}providing insights on what large-scale geo-tagged data can achieve in understanding place formalization and urban design.},

However, the vague nature of places and the complex spatial relationships among places make it intractable to understand and represent the hierarchies among places. In this paper, we introduce a fuzzy formal concept analysis-based approach to uncovering the spatial hierarchies among vague places. Each place is represented as a concept that consists of its extent and its intent. Based on the place concepts, the spatial hierarchies are generated and expressed as a graph that is easy to comprehend and contains abundant information on spatial relations.

GIS can effectively handle spatial entities and offer sophisticated analysis and modelling functions to deal with space. Only a small fraction of the literature in Geographic Information Science\&mdash;or GIScience in short\&mdash;has advanced the development of place, addressing entities with an ambiguous boundary and relying more on the human or social attributes of a location rather than on crisp geographic boundaries. While the GIScience developments support the establishment of the digital humanities, GISs were never designed to handle subjective or vague data. We, an international group of authors, juxtapose place and space in English language and in several other languages and discuss potential consequences for Geoinformatics and GIScience. In particular, we address the question of whether linguistic and cultural settings play a role in the perception of place. We report on some facts revealed by this multi-language and multi-cultural dialogue, and what particular aspects of place we were able to discern regarding the few languages addressed.},

Auditing socioeconomic and demographic patterns traditionally entails producing a large portion of data by human-participant surveys, which are usually costly and time consuming. Even with newly developed computational methods, amenity characteristics such as typeface, color, and graphic element choices are still missing at the city scale. However, they have a huge impact on personalized preferences. Currently, researchers tend to use large-scale street view imagery to uncover physical and socioeconomic patterns. In this research, we first propose a framework that uses deep convolutional neural network to recognize the typeface from street view imagery in London. Second, we analyze the relationship between 11 typefaces and the average household income in 77 wards of London. The result show that the typefaces used in the neighborhood are highly correlated with economic and demographic factors. Typeface could be an alternative metric to evaluate economic and demographic status in large-scale urban regions. More generally, typeface can also act as a key visual characteristic of a city.},

Currently, it is difficult to track social, economic, environmental and health outcomes in cities with high spatial and temporal resolution, needed to evaluate policies regarding urban inequalities. We applied a deep learning approach to street~images for measuring spatial distributions of income, education, unemployment, housing, living environment, health and crime. Our model predicts different outcomes directly from raw images without extracting intermediate user-defined features. To evaluate the performance of the approach, we first trained neural networks on a subset of images from London using ground truth data at high spatial resolution from official statistics. We then compared how trained networks separated the best-off from worst-off deciles for different outcomes in images not used in training. The best performance was achieved for quality of the living environment and mean income. Allocation was least successful for crime and self-reported health (but not objectively measured health). We also evaluated how networks trained in London predict outcomes three other major cities in the UK: Birmingham, Manchester, and Leeds. The transferability analysis showed that networks trained in London, fine-tuned with only 1\% of images in other cities, achieved performances similar to ones from trained on data from target cities themselves. Our findings demonstrate that street~imagery has the potential complement traditional survey-based and administrative data sources for high-resolution urban surveillance to measure inequalities and monitor the impacts of policies that aim to address them.},

Previous studies have relied on low-throughput surveys and limited data sources, which have difficulty in measuring the human perception of a large-scale urban region at flexible spatial resolutions. In this work, a data-driven machine learning approach is proposed to measure how people perceive a place in a large-scale urban region. Specifically, a deep learning model, which has been trained on millions of human ratings of street-level imagery, was used to predict human perceptions of a street view image. The model achieved a high accuracy rate in predicting six human perceptual indicators, namely, safe, lively, beautiful, wealthy, depressing, and boring. This model can help to map the distribution of the city-wide human perception for a new urban region. Furthermore, a series of statistical analyses was conducted to determine the visual elements that may cause a place to be perceived as different perceptions. From the 150 object categories segmented from the street view images, various objects were identified as being positively or negatively correlated with each of the six perceptual indicators. The results take researchers and urban planners one step toward understanding the interactions of the place sentiments and semantics.},

Understanding and representing a locale is of great importance in terms of human perception and human activity. However, taking a quantitative measurement of the visual appearance of urban environment has proven to be challenging because visual information is inherently ambiguous and semantically impoverished. To mitigate this issue, this paper employs street-level images as the proxy for urban physical appearance, utilizes the recently developed image semantic segmentation techniques to parse an urban scene into scene elements, and proposes a framework for locale representation using scene elements. The framework is composed of two major components: street scene ontology and street visual descriptor, which are aimed at street scene qualitative understanding and quantitative representation respectively. A case study is developed to demonstrate the application and advantage of the street scene ontology and street visual descriptor. A series of quantitative analyses demonstrates the ability and great potential of the framework for investigating the connections between place and other socioeconomic factors.},

We analyze the tradeoff between accuracy, spatial resolution, and number of training samples, as well as the heterogeneity of the predicted results across different spatial locations, demographics, and firm industries. Finally, we demonstrate the cross-city generality of this method by training the model in one city and then applying it directly to other cities.

Urban areas are becoming increasingly dominant social-ecological systems, so it is important to understand patterns of urbanization. Most studies of urban landscape pattern examine land-use maps in two dimensions because the acquisition of 3-dimensional information is difficult. We used Brista software based on Quickbird images and aerial photos to interpret the height of buildings, thus incorporating a 3-dimensional approach. We estimated the feasibility and accuracy of this approach. A total of 164,345 buildings in the Liaoning central urban agglomeration of China, which included seven cities, were measured. Twelve landscape metrics were proposed or chosen to describe the urban landscape patterns in 2- and 3-dimensional scales. The ecological and social meaning of landscape metrics were analyzed with multiple correlation analysis. The results showed that classification accuracy compared with field surveys was 87.6\%, which means this method for interpreting building height was acceptable. The metrics effectively reflected the urban architecture in relation to number of buildings, area, height, 3-D shape and diversity aspects. We were able to describe the urban characteristics of each city with these metrics. The metrics also captured ecological and social meanings. The proposed landscape metrics provided a new method for urban landscape analysis in three dimensions.},

	abstract = {Urban scaling laws relate socio-economic, behavioral, and physical variables to the population size of cities and allow for a new paradigm of city planning, and an understanding of urban resilience and economies. Independently of culture and climate, almost all cities exhibit two fundamental scaling exponents, one sub-linear and one super-linear that are related. Here we show that based on fundamental fractal geometric relations of cities we derive both exponents and their relation. Sub-linear scaling arises as the ratio of the fractal dimensions of the road network and the distribution of the population in 3D. Super-linear scaling emerges from human interactions that are constrained by the city geometry. We demonstrate the validity of the framework with data on 4750 European cities. We make several testable predictions, including the relation of average height of cities with population size, and that at a critical population size, growth changes from horizontal densification to three-dimensional growth.},

	abstract = {Human behavior drives a range of complex social, urban, and economic systems, yet understanding its structure and dynamics at the individual level remains an open question. From credit card transactions to communications data, human behavior appears to exhibit bursts of activity driven by task prioritization and periodicity, however, current research does not offer generative models capturing these mechanisms. We propose a multivariate, periodic Hawkes process (MPHP) model that captures {\textemdash} at the individual level {\textemdash}the temporal clustering of human activity, the interdependence structure and co-excitation of different activities, and the periodic effects of weekly rhythms. We also propose a scalable parameter estimation technique for this model using maximum-aposteriori expectationmaximization that additionally provides estimation of latent variables revealing branching structure of an individual{\textquoteright}s behavior patterns. We apply the model to a large dataset of credit card transactions, and demonstrate the MPHP outperforms a non-homogeneous Poisson model and LDA in both statistical fit for the distribution of inter-event times and an activity prediction task.},

This study aims to explore the space-time structure of population distribution with area-level mobile phone data. We discuss a kind of Bayesian hierarchical models, fitted by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation, that combines the overall spatial pattern and temporal trends as well as the departures from these stable components. We carry out an empirical study in Shenzhen, China, using the area-level mobile phone users in 24 hours. The results indicate that the estimation of the overall spatial pattern is not deteriorated when using a sophisticated spatio-temporal model. The temporal trend exhibits a reasonable fluctuation during the study period. Then we apply two rules to detect areas showing unstable trends of population fluctuation based on the posterior probabilities of the space-time interactions. We also include the population statistics and indices for mixed-use to explore the spatial pattern of population fluctuation. Our findings confirm that the Bayesian spatio-temporal model can enhance the understanding of the space-time variability of population distribution using mobile phone data. Further research should examine the spatial nonstationary effects of explanatory factors on mobile phone-based population fluctuation.},

According to the so-called Compact City Approach, high density and centrality should lead to low GHG. This study compares the effect of the urban density and spatial structure (monocentrism, polycentrism, and dispersion) of the main U.S. cities on their greenhouse gas emissions from mobility and housing. The estimated models include control variables in order to improve the statistical adjustment, these variables are grouped into three categories: basic controls as temperature and Gross Domestic Product (GDP); historical-demographic controls since 1900; and geographic-urban planning controls. The results detect an environmentally positive effect, albeit a moderate one, associated with monocentric and polycentric spatial structures as compared to dispersed structures. Within the tradition of urban planning, these results can be used as an argument to stop the dispersed decentralization of cities. However, the efficacy of some policies encouraging density should be accompanied by specific policies which increase the energy efficiency of housing and promote the use of public transport.},

	abstract = {Numerous urban indicators scale with population in a power law across cities, but whether the cross-sectional scaling law is applicable to the temporal growth of individual cities is unclear. Here we first find two paradoxical scaling relationships that urban built-up area sub-linearly scales with population across cities, but super-linearly scales with population over time in most individual cities because urban land expands faster than population grows. Different cities have diverse temporal scaling exponents and one city even has opposite temporal scaling regimes during two periods, strongly supporting the absence of single temporal scaling and further illustrating the failure of cross-sectional urban scaling in predicting temporal growth of cities. We propose a conceptual model that can clarify the essential difference and also connections between the cross-sectional scaling law and temporal trajectories of cities. Our model shows that cities have an extra growth of built-up area over time besides the supposed growth predicted by the cross-sectional scaling law. Disparities of extra growth among different-sized cities change the cross-sectional scaling exponent. Further analyses of GDP and other indicators confirm the contradiction between cross-sectional and temporal scaling relationships and the validity of the conceptual model. Our findings may open a new avenue towards the science of cities.},

However, the approach makes no precise expressions of its weighting kernels and is insufficient to estimate complex geographical processes. To resolve these problems, we proposed a geographically neural network weighted regression (GNNWR) model that combines ordinary least squares (OLS) and neural networks to estimate spatial non-stationarity based on a concept similar to GWR. Specifically, we designed a spatially weighted neural network (SWNN) to represent the nonstationary weight matrix in GNNWR and developed two case studies to examine the effectiveness of GNNWR. The first case used simulated datasets, and the second case, environmental observations from the coastal areas of Zhejiang. The results showed that GNNWR achieved better fitting accuracy and more adequate prediction than OLS and GWR. In addition, GNNWR is applicable to addressing spatial non-stationarity in various domains with complex geographical processes.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of personal sensing devices has enabled the collection of large, diverse, and fine-grained spatio-temporal datasets. These datasets facilitate numerous applications from traffic monitoring and management to location-based services. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in profiling individuals' movements for personalized services based on fine-grained trajectory data. Most approaches identify the most representative paths of a user by analyzing coarse location information, e.g., frequently visited places. However, even for trips that share the same origin and destination, individuals exhibit a variety of behaviors (e.g., a school drop detour, a brief stop at a supermarket). The ability to characterize and compare the variability of individuals' fine-grained movement behavior can greatly support location-based services and smart spatial sampling strategies. We propose a TRip DIversity Measure {\textendash}TRIM {\textendash} that quantifies the regularity of users' path choice between an origin and destination. TRIM effectively captures the extent of the diversity of the paths that are taken between a given origin and destination pair, and identifies users with distinct movement patterns, while facilitating the comparison of the movement behavior variations between users. Our experiments using synthetic and real datasets and across geographies show the effectiveness of our method.},

The authorities often rush to regulate the services without a good knowledge of these new options. In Singapore and some other cities, dockless bike-sharing systems rose and fell in just one year and were followed by the booming of docking scooter-sharing systems. This study conducts a comparative analysis of bike-sharing and scooter-sharing activities in Singapore to help understand the phenomenon and inform policy-making. Based on the collected data (i.e., origin-destination pairs enriched with the departure and arrival time and the GPS locations) for one month, this study proposed methods to construct the paths and estimated repositioning trips and the fleet sizes. Hence, the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the two systems in two discrete urban areas was investigated. It explored the impact of the fleet size, operational regulations (dockless versus docking), and weather conditions on the usages. We found that shared scooters have spatially compact and quantitatively denser distribution compared with shared bikes, and their high demands associate with places such as attractions, metros, and the dormitory. Results suggest that scooter sharing has a better performance than bike sharing in terms of the increased sharing frequency and decreased fleet size; however, the shareability still has potential to be improved. High repositioning rates of shared-scooters indicates high maintenance cost for rebalancing and charging. Rainfall and high temperatures at noon suppress the usages but not conclusively. The study also proposes several initiatives to promote the sustainable development of scooter-sharing services.},

	abstract = {The acceptability, energy consumption, and environmental benefits of electric vehicles are highly dependent on travel patterns. With increasing ride-hailing popularity in mega-cities, urban mobility patterns are greatly changing; therefore, an investigation of the extent to which electric vehicles would satisfy the needs of ride-hailing drivers becomes important to support sustainable urban growth. A first step in this direction is reported here. GPS-trajectories of 144,867 drivers over 104 million km in Beijing were used to quantify the potential acceptability, energy consumption, and costs of ride-hailing electric vehicle fleets. Average daily travel distance and travel time for ride-hailing drivers was determined to be 129.4 km and 5.7 h; these values are substantially larger than those for household drivers (40.0 km and 1.5 h). Assuming slow level-1 (1.8 KW) or moderate level-2 (7.2 KW) charging is available at all home parking locations, battery electric vehicles with 200 km all electric range (BEV200) could be used by up to 47\% or 78\% of ride-hailing drivers and electrify up to 20\% or 55\% of total distance driven by the ride-hailing fleet. With level-2 charging available at home, work, and public parking, the acceptance ceiling increases to up to 91\% of drivers and 80\% of distance. Our study suggests that long range BEVs and widespread level-2 charging infrastructure are needed for large-scale electrification of ride-hailing mobility in Beijing. The marginal benefits of increased all electric range, effects on charging infrastructure distribution, and payback times are also presented and discussed. Given the observed heterogeneity of ride-hailing vehicle travel, our study outlines the importance of individual-level analysis to understand the electrification potential and future benefits of electric vehicles in the era of shared smart transportation.},

	abstract = {Detecting movement patterns with complicated spatial or temporal characteristics is a challenge. The past decade has witnessed the success of deep learning in processing image, voice and text data. However, its application in movement pattern detection is not fully exploited. To address the research gap, this paper develops a deep learning approach to detect regional dominant movement patterns (RDMP) in trajectory data. Specifically, a novel feature descriptor called directional flow image (DFI) is firstly proposed to store the local directional movement information in trajectory data. A DFI classification model called TRNet is designed based on convolutional neural network. The model is then trained with a synthetic trajectory dataset covering 11 classes of commonly encountered movement patterns in reality. Finally, a sliding window detector is built to detect RDMP at multiple scales and a clustering-based merging method is proposed to prune the redundant detection results. Training of TRNet on the synthetic dataset achieves considerably high accuracy. Experiments on a real-world taxi trajectory dataset further demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in discovering complex movement patterns in trajectory data.},

However, in its raw form, GPS taxi data does not offer information on the purpose (or intended activity) of travel. In this context, to enhance the utility of taxi GPS data sets, we propose a two-layer framework to identify the related activities of each taxi trip automatically and estimate the return trips and successive activities after the trip, by using geographic point-of-interest (POI) data and a combination of spatio-temporal clustering, Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo simulation. Two million taxi trips in New York, the United States of America, and ten million taxi trips in Shenzhen, China, are used as inputs for the two-layer framework. To validate each layer of the framework, we collect 6,003 trip diaries in New York and 712 questionnaire surveys in Shenzhen. The results show that the first layer of the framework performs better than comparable methods published in the literature, while the second layer has high accuracy when inferring return trips.},

	abstract = {The availability of vast amounts of location-based data from social media platforms such as Twitter has enabled us to look deeply into the dynamics of human movement. The aim of this paper is to leverage a large collection of geo-tagged tweets and the street networks of two major metropolitan areas{\textemdash}London and Tokyo{\textemdash}to explore the underlying mechanism that determines the heterogeneity of human mobility patterns. For the two target cities, hundreds of thousands of tweet locations and road segments were processed to generate city hotspots and natural streets. User movement trajectories and city hotspots were then used to build a hotspot network capable of quantitatively characterizing the heterogeneous movement patterns of people within the cities. To emulate observed movement patterns, the study conducts a two-level agent-based simulation that includes random walks through the hotspot networks and movements in the street networks using each of three distance types{\textemdash}metric, angular and combined. Comparisons of the simulated and observed movement flows at the segment and street levels show that the heterogeneity of human urban movements at the collective level is mainly shaped by the scaling structure of the urban space.},

We leveraged a new mobility data source, the dockless bike-sharing service Mobike, to quantify short-trip transportation patterns in Shanghai, China, the world{\textquoteright}s largest bike-share city. A data-driven framework was established to integrate multiple data sources, including transportation network data (roads, bikes, and public transit), road characteristics, and urban land use, to achieve a detailed, accurate analysis of cycling patterns at both the individual and group levels. The results provide a comprehensive view of mobility patterns in the use of shared-ride bicycles, including: (1) the temporal and spatiotemporal distribution of shared-bike usage and how this varies according to different land use; (2) the statistical distribution of Mobike trips, which are primarily short-distance; and (3) the travel behavior and road factors that influence Mobike users{\textquoteright} route choice. The findings offer valuable insights for city planners regarding infrastructure development, for shared-ride bike companies to offer better bike rebalancing strategies to meet user demand, and for the promotion of this new green transportation mode to alleviate traffic congestion and enhance public health.},

	abstract = {Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) has been broadly used in various fields to model spatially non-stationary relationships. Multi-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) is a recent advancement to the classic GWR model. MGWR is superior in capturing multi-scale processes over the traditional single-scale GWR model by using different bandwidths for each covariate. However, the multiscale property of MGWR brings additional computation costs. The calibration process of MGWR involves iterative back-fitting under the additive model (AM) framework. Currently, MGWR can only be applied on small datasets within a tolerable time and is prohibitively time-consuming to run with moderately large datasets (greater than 5,000 observations). In this paper, we propose a parallel implementation that has crucial computational improvements to the MGWR calibration. This improved computational method reduces both memory footprint and runtime to allow MGWR modelling to be applied to moderate-to-large datasets (up to 100,000 observations). These improvements are integrated into the mgwr python package and the MGWR 2.0 software, both of which are freely available to download.},

Limitations of conventional statistical methods for analysis of individual-level human activities have encouraged spatiotemporal analysis of human activity patterns in a space{\textendash}time context. Based on H{\"a}gerstrand{\textquoteright}s time geography, this study presents a space{\textendash}time GIS approach that is capable of representing and analyzing spatiotemporal activity data at the individual level. Specifically, we have developed an ArcGIS extension, named Activity Pattern Analyst (APA), to facilitate exploratory analysis of activity diary data. This extension covers a set of functions such as space{\textendash}time path generation, space{\textendash}time path segmentation, space{\textendash}time path filter, and activity distribution/density pattern exploration. It also provides a space{\textendash}time path based multi-level clustering method to investigate individual-level spatiotemporal patterns. Using an activity diary dataset collected in Beijing, China, this paper presents how this Activity Pattern Analyst extension can facilitate exploratory analysis of individual activity diary data to uncover spatiotemporal patterns of individual activities.},

Creating more walkable streets and neighborhoods is an important way to promote an active lifestyle for urban residents. It is therefore important to understand how the urban built environment can influence human walking activities. In this study, we investigated the interaction of human walking activities and physical characteristics of streetscapes in Boston. A large number of anonymous pedestrian trajectories collected from a smartphone application were used to estimate human walking activities. Publicly accessible Google Street View images were used to estimate the amount of street greenery and the enclosure of street canyons, both of which were used to indicate the physical characteristics of streetscapes. The Walk Score and population were also added in the statistical analyses to control the influence of nearby urban facilities and population on human walking activities. Statistical analysis results show that both the street greenery and the enclosure of the street canyons are significantly associated with human walking activities. The associations between the streetscape variables and human walking activities vary in different land use types. The results of this study have implications for designing walkable and healthy cities.},

Exposure to human mobility patterns is measured by big data computational strategy for identifying hundreds of millions of individuals' space{\textendash}time footprint trajectories. Linguistic data are coded as a proxy for cultural ties from a unique geographically coded atlas of dialect distributions. We find that cultural ties are associated with human mobility flows between city pairs, contingent on commuting costs and geographical distances.

These findings present useful insights in support of the cultural mechanism that can account for the rise, decline, and dynamics of human mobility between regions.},

It took several weeks for the network to re-equilibrate, during which period travelers continued to learn and adjust their travel decisions. A good understanding of this process is crucial for traffic management and the design of mitigation schemes. Data from loop-detectors, bus ridership statistics, and a survey are analyzed and compared, revealing the evolving traffic reactions to the bridge collapse and how individual choices could help to explain such dynamics. Findings on short-term traffic dynamics and behavioral reactions to this major network disruption have important implications for traffic management in response to future scenarios.},

	abstract = {Data generators have been heavily used in creating massive trajectory datasets to address common challenges of real-world datasets, including privacy, cost of data collection, and data quality. However, such generators often overlook social and physiological characteristics of individuals and as such their results are often limited to simple movement patterns. To address these shortcomings, we propose an agent-based simulation framework that facilitates the development of behavioral models in which agents correspond to individuals that act based on personal preferences, goals, and needs within a realistic geographical environment. Researchers can use a drag-and-drop interface to design and control their own world including the geospatial and social (i.e. geo-social) properties. The framework is capable of generating and streaming very large data that captures the basic patterns of life in urban areas. Streaming data from the simulation can be accessed in real time through a dedicated API.},

	abstract = {The spatiotemporal variability in air pollutant concentrations raises challenges in linking air pollution exposure to individual health outcomes. Thus, understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility plays an important role in air pollution epidemiology and health studies. With the advantages of massive users, wide spatial coverage and passive acquisition capability, mobile phone data have become an emerging data source for compiling exposure estimates. However, compared with air pollution monitoring data, the temporal granularity of mobile phone data is not high enough, which limits the performance of individual exposure estimation. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel method of estimating dynamic individual air pollution exposure levels using trajectories reconstructed from mobile phone data. Using the city of Shanghai as a case study, we compared three different types of exposure estimates using (1) reconstructed mobile phone trajectories, (2) recorded mobile phone trajectories, and (3) residential locations. The results demonstrate the necessity of trajectory reconstruction in exposure and health risk assessment. Additionally, we measure the potential health effects of air pollution from both individual and geographical perspectives. This helped reveal the temporal variations in individual exposures and the spatial distribution of residential areas with high exposure levels. The proposed method allows us to perform large-area and long-term exposure estimations for a large number of residents at a high spatiotemporal resolution, which helps support policy-driven environmental actions and reduce potential health risks.},

This problem is more substantial when mining collective patterns from big geo-data due to the characteristics of extensive spatial data. Although multi-scale models were constructed to mitigate this issue, most studies still arbitrarily choose a single scale to extract spatial patterns. In this research, we introduce the nugget-sill ratio (NSR) derived from semi-variograms as an indicator to extract the optimal scale. We conducted two simulated experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of this method. Our results showed that the optimal scale is negatively correlated with spatial point density, but positively correlated with the degree of dispersion in a point pattern. We also applied the proposed method to a case study using Weibo check-in data from Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Wuhan. Our study provides a new perspective to measure the spatial heterogeneity of big geo-data and selects an optimal spatial scale for big data analytics.},

Existing studies mostly focus on describing the quantitative relationship between imported cases and local transmission but ignore the space-time diffusion mode of imported cases under the influence of individual mobility. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework at a fine scale to establish the disease transmission network and a mathematical model, which constructs {\textquoteleft}source-sink{\textquoteright} links between the imported and indigenous cases on a regular grid with a spatial resolution of 1 km to explore the diffusion pattern and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of imported cases. An application to Guangzhou, China, reveals the main flow and transmission path of imported cases under the influence of human movement and identifies the spatiotemporal distribution of transmission speed according to the time lag of each source-sink link. In addition, we demonstrate that using individual-based movement data and socio-economic factors to study human mobility and imported cases can help to understand the driving forces of dengue spread. Our research provides a comprehensive framework for the analysis of early dengue transmission patterns with benefits to similar urban applications.},

Matching and conflating these heterogeneous trajectories help to enhance trajectory semantics, describe user portraits, and discover specified groups from human mobility. In this paper, we proposed a high-performance approach for matching spatiotemporal trajectories across heterogeneous massive datasets. Two indicators, i.e., Time Weighted Similarity (TWS) and Space Weighted Similarity (SWS), are proposed to measure the similarity of spatiotemporal trajectories. The core idea is that trajectories are more similar if they stay close in a longer time and distance. A distributed computing framework based on Spark is built for efficient trajectory matching among massive datasets. In the framework, the trajectory segments are partitioned into 3-dimensional space{\textendash}time cells for parallel processing, and a novel method of segment reference point is designed to avoid duplicated computation. We conducted extensive matching experiments on real-world and synthetic trajectory datasets. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach outperforms other similarity metrics in accuracy, and the Spark-based framework greatly improves the efficiency in spatiotemporal trajectory matching.},

	abstract = {Travel patterns can be impacted by abnormal events. Assessing the impacts has important implications for relief operations and improving preparedness or planning for future events. Conventionally, the assessment is done followed by data collection from post-event surveys, which are economically costly, suffering low-response rate, time-consuming and usually delayed for months (or even years) after an event, leading to inefficient and unreliable assessment and creating obstacles for relief organizations to reach people in need. Penetration of smartphones and services enabled by them continuously generate large amount of trajectory data (e.g., Call Records Data, App-based data), containing trajectories of massive users. These trajectory data are passively and timely collected and without additional cost and contain information of travel patterns of the massive number of individuals in a region for a prolonged time period (e.g., months to years). We propose a framework to assessing the impacts on travel patterns using these data. Utilizing the passively collected trajectory data, the proposed framework seeks to capturing and understanding the full spectrum of travel pattern changes, which helps to assess who, when and how people in a certain area were impacted. The proposed framework is applied to a mobile phone trajectory dataset containing about half-year trajectories of a million anonymous users to assess the impacts of Hurricane Harvey (the second-costliest hurricane in US history). The results are validated and show that the proposed framework can provide a comprehensive assessment of impacts of Harvey on travel patterns, which could guide the response to and the recovery from the impacts.},

In this study, a general framework combining null models is proposed to quantify the impact of the topology, weight correlation and statistics on link prediction in weighted networks. Three null models for topology and weight distribution of weighted networks are presented. All the links of the original network can be divided into strong and weak ties. We can use null models to verify the strong effect of weak or strong ties. For two important statistics, we construct two null models to measure their impacts on link prediction. In our experiments, the proposed method is applied to seven empirical networks, which demonstrates that this model is universal and the impact of the topology and weight distribution of these networks in link prediction can be quantified by it. We find that in the USAir, the Celegans, the Gemo, the Lesmis and the CatCortex, the strong ties are easier to predict, but there are a few networks whose weak edges can be predicted more easily, such as the Netscience and the CScientists. It is also found that the weak ties contribute more to link prediction in the USAir, the NetScience and the CScientists, that is, the strong effect of weak ties exists in these networks. The framework we proposed is versatile, which is not only used to link prediction but also applicable to other directions in complex networks.},

	abstract = {A central claim in modern network science is that real-world networks are typically "scale free," meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree \$k\$ follows a power law, decaying like \$k{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, often with \$2 {\textless} {\textbackslash}alpha {\textless} 3\$. However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an activity sequence-based indoor pedestrian localization approach using smartphones. The activity sequence consists of several continuous activities during the walking process, such as turning at a corner, taking the elevator, taking the escalator, and walking stairs. These activities take place when a user walks at some special points in the building, like corners, elevators, escalators, and stairs. The special points form an indoor road network. In our approach, we first detect the user{\textquoteright}s activities using the built-in sensors in a smartphone. The detected activities constitute the activity sequence. Meanwhile, the user{\textquoteright}s trajectory is reckoned by Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR). Based on the detected activity sequence and reckoned trajectory, we realize pedestrian localization by matching them to the indoor road network using a Hidden Markov Model. After encountering several special points, the location of the user would converge on the true one. We evaluate our proposed approach using smartphones in two buildings: an office building and a shopping mall. The results show that the proposed approach can realize autonomous pedestrian localization even without knowing the initial point in the environments. The mean offline localization error is about 1.3 m. The results also demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust to activity detection error and PDR estimation error.},

	abstract = {WiFi fingerprinting-based indoor localization has been widely used due to its simplicity and can be implemented on the smartphones. The major drawback of WiFi fingerprinting is that the radio map construction is very labor-intensive and time-consuming. Another drawback of WiFi fingerprinting is the Received Signal Strength (RSS) variance problem, caused by environmental changes and device diversity. RSS variance severely degrades the localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a robust crowdsourcing-based indoor localization system (RCILS). RCILS can automatically construct the radio map using crowdsourcing data collected by smartphones. RCILS abstracts the indoor map as the semantics graph in which the edges are the possible user paths and the vertexes are the location where users may take special activities. RCILS extracts the activity sequence contained in the trajectories by activity detection and pedestrian dead-reckoning. Based on the semantics graph and activity sequence, crowdsourcing trajectories can be located and a radio map is constructed based on the localization results. For the RSS variance problem, RCILS uses the trajectory fingerprint model for indoor localization. During online localization, RCILS obtains an RSS sequence and realizes localization by matching the RSS sequence with the radio map. To evaluate RCILS, we apply RCILS in an office building. Experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of RCILS.},

	abstract = {The existing studies concerning the influence of weather on public transport have mainly focused on the impacts of average weather conditions on the aggregate ridership of public transit. Not much research has examined these impacts at disaggregate levels. This study aims to fill this gap by accounting for intra-day variations in weather as well as public transport ridership and investigating the effect of weather on the travel behavior of individual public transit users. We have collected smart card data for public transit and meteorological records from Shenzhen, China for the entire month of September 2014. The data allow us to establish association between the system-wide public transit ridership and weather condition on not only daily, but also hourly basis and for each metro station. In addition, with the detailed trip records of individual card holders, the travel pattern by public transit are constructed for card holders and this pattern is linked to the weather conditions he/she has experienced. Multivariate modeling approach is applied to analyze the influence of weather on public transit ridership and the travel behavior of regular transit users. Results show that some weather elements have more influence than others on public transportation. Metro stations located in urban areas are more vulnerable to outdoor weather in regard to ridership. Regular transit users are found to be rather resilient to changes in weather conditions. Findings contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between everyday weather and public transit travels and also provide valuable information for short-term scheduling in transit management.},

By using crowdsourcing data on mobile phone sensors, we can derive activity landmarks where people perform different activities (turning, taking the elevator, taking the escalator, and walking up/down the stairs). Our method uses graph optimization techniques to align crowdsourcing trajectories by their intersecting landmarks. After trajectory alignment, this method applies a pose graph optimization method to construct an indoor map. Finally, our method performs a transform from relative coordinates to an absolute coordinate with reference points and reduces the redundant segments using dynamic time warping. To evaluate the performance, we implement the proposed method in an office building and a shopping mall. Experiment results show that 80th percentile error of the mapping accuracy is about 1.7{\textendash}3.5 m. Moreover, the proposed method can deal with the curved routes in a building and can also decrease the amount of required data.},

	abstract = {Online-to-offline (O2O) commerce connecting service providers and individuals to address daily human needs is quickly expanding. In particular, on-demand food, whereby food orders are placed online by customers and delivered by couriers, is becoming popular. This novel urban food application requires highly efficient and scalable real-time delivery services. However, it is difficult to recruit enough couriers and route them to facilitate such food ordering systems. This article presents an online crowdsourced delivery approach for on-demand food. Facilitated by Internet-of-Things and 3G/4G/5G technologies, public riders can be attracted to act as crowdsourced workers delivering food by means of shared bicycles or electric motorbikes. An online dynamic optimization framework comprising order collection, solution generation, and sequential delivery processes is presented. A hybrid metaheuristic solution process integrating the adaptive large neighborhood search and tabu search approaches is developed to assign food delivery tasks and generate high-quality delivery routes in a real-time manner. The crowdsourced riders are dynamically shared among different food providers. Simulated small-scale and real-world large-scale on-demand food delivery instances are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the presented crowdsourced food delivery approach outperforms traditional urban logistics. The developed hybrid optimization mechanism is able to produce high-quality crowdsourced delivery routes in less than 120 seconds. The results demonstrate that the presented online crowdsourced delivery approach can facilitate city-scale on-demand food delivery.},

	abstract = {For a city to be livable and walkable is the ultimate goal of future cities. However, conflicts among pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists at traffic intersections are becoming severe in high-density urban transportation areas, especially in China. Correspondingly, the transit time at intersections is becoming prolonged, and pedestrian safety is becoming endangered. Simulating pedestrian movements at complex traffic intersections is necessary to optimize the traffic organization. We propose an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based method for tracking and simulating pedestrian movements at intersections. Specifically, high-resolution videos acquired by a UAV are used to recognize and position moving targets, including pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles, using the convolutional neural network. An improved social force-based motion model is proposed, considering the conflicts among pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles. In addition, maximum likelihood estimation is performed to calibrate an improved social force model. UAV videos of intersections in Shenzhen are analyzed to demonstrate the performance of the presented approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed social force-based motion model can effectively simulate the movement of pedestrians and cyclists at road intersections. The presented approach provides an alternative method to track and simulate pedestrian movements, thus benefitting the organization of pedestrian flow and traffic signals controlling the intersections.},

Reducing pedestrian{\textemdash}vehicle conflict points and expanding network capacities are two possible approaches to improving operational efficiency, especially when network accessibility varies in different evacuation stages. This paper integrates two types of network reconfiguration strategies, namely, the use of contraflow lane reversal for road lanes and pedestrian walkways and time-dependent conflict point elimination by separating pedestrian and vehicle flows with physical barriers at road intersections, to strategize pedestrian and vehicle moving directions during a mass evacuation. A multiobjective optimization model is formulated to adaptively select the appropriate locations for barriers according to different evacuation phases, and the model is solved by a modified genetic algorithm-based heuristic approach. An experiment on optimizing an urban regional evacuation network configuration in the case of a toxic gas leak accident was carried out to validate the proposed model. The numerical results show an increase of approximately 15\% in the maximum evacuee throughput and a reduction of approximately 65\% in the average exposure risk of evacuees of the optimal plans compared with the uncontrolled plan.},

While some countries were completely locked down, as was the case in Italy, some had claimed to have very few or no cases, as was the case in Turkey and Indonesia by March 10th, 2020. Nevertheless, the spread of COVID-19 from China has been clearly linked to those travelling from Wuhan in Hubei province in Central China. Therefore, it is important to understand the travel density/volume of passengers carried as well as routes from Wuhan through connected main regional air travel hubs across China. In this study, we developed a model on migration and travel intensity that can explain outbreak and spread of COVID-19 since it appeared at the end of 2019. We show that the presence of migrant stock populations of Chinese origin and the immigrant stock in China are useful indicators in the prediction of the spread of the outbreak worldwide in the event of interaction with several other macro factors. We argue that monitoring immigrant stock data and travel volume data based on human mobility corridors (i.e. origins and destinations), countries could have been better prepared and taken early measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.},

This paper analyzes changes in the spatio-temporal characteristics of the Spatial-Interaction Networks of Beijing (SINB) in three consecutive steps. To begin with, we constructed 24 sequential snapshots of spatial population interactions on the basis of points of interest (POIs) collected from Dianping.com and various taxi GPS data in Beijing. Then, we used Jensen{\textendash}Shannon distance and hierarchical clustering to integrate the 24 sequential network snapshots into four clusters. Finally, we improved the weighted k-core decomposition method by combining the complex network method and weighted distance in a geographic space. The results showed: (1) There are three layers in the SINB: a core layer, a bridge layer, and a periphery layer. The number of places greatly varies, and the SINB show an obvious hierarchical structure at different periods. The core layer contains fewer places that are between the Second and Fifth Ring Road in Beijing. Moreover, spatial distribution of places in the bridge layer is always in the same location as that of the core layer, and the quantity in the bridge layer is always superior to that in the core layer. The distributions of places in the periphery layer, however, are much greater and wider than the other two layers. (2) The SINB connected compactly over time, bearing much resemblance to a small-world network. (3) Two patterns of connection, each with different connecting ratios between layers, appear on weekdays and weekends, respectively. Our research plays a vital role in understanding urban spatial heterogeneity, and helps to support decisions in urban planning and traffic management.},

In addition to calls and text messages, people are utilizing mobile apps and websites to connect to the world and explore different content anytime and anywhere. The use of smart phones generates billions of records, including spatiotemporal trajectories, and various mobile phone usage details, such as call duration, and frequency of visiting a certain type of website. Most transportation researchers have only focused on spatiotemporal traces, which represent activitytravel behavior of users. However, it is worth making full use of smart phone data to study how mobile phone usage is related to activity-travel behavior. This chapter first reviews the existing literature on the relevant topics to demonstrate the lack of research on the relationship between mobile internet usage and activity-travel behavior. Based on an 11-day dataset from Shanghai that includes not only spatiotemporal traces but also the frequencies of browsing different categories of mobile internet content (e.g., tourism and finance), we examine several relationships between mobile internet usage and activity-travel behavior.},

	abstract = {Night-time light (NTL) remote sensing data has been widely used in the analysis of human activities at night for a large extent, such as light pollution monitoring and recognition of urban functional regions. In most previous studies, the spatial resolutions of NTL remote sensing data are rather low (e.g., 500 m or coarser). Besides, remote sensing classification of land use rather than land cover types is often a hard task. Due to the reasons, it is difficult to meet the demand of urban refined management. In this study, mobile big data and Luojia1-01(LJ1-01) NTL remote sensing satellite data with higher spatial resolution are adopted for extracting urban functional regions at the street-level scale. Taking Shenzhen city as a case, mobile big data (i.e., the volume of mobile devices) with the accuracy of approximate 150 m (i.e., 7-bit GeoHash encoding format) is integrated with NTL remote sensing data. After a hot spot analysis, the correlation between the two types of data are analysed. The typical supervised classification algorithms including KNN, SVM and random forest are used to distinguish urban functional regions, which are represented by five types, namely residential, business and commercial, industrial, transportation and other areas. The results show the effectiveness in extracting land use types in cities by combination of Luojia1-01 night-time light remote sensing and mobile big data. This study provides a basis for monitoring night light pollution of residential area, urban planning and the construction of smart cities.},

Understanding the causes behind this phenomenon is of great significance for urban space optimization. Various spatial big data make the fine description of urban residents{\textquoteright} travel behaviors possible, and bring new approaches to related studies. The present study focuses on two aspects: one is to obtain relatively accurate features of commuting behaviors by using mobile phone data, and the other is to simulate commuting behaviors of residents through the agent-based model and inducing backward the causes of congestion. Taking the Baishazhou area of Wuhan, a local area of a mega city in China, as a case study, we simulated the travel behaviors of commuters: the spatial context of the model is set up using the existing urban road network and by dividing the area into space units. Then, using the mobile phone call detail records of a month, statistics of residents{\textquoteright} travel during the four time slots in working day mornings are acquired and then used to generate the Origin-Destination matrix of travels at different time slots, and the data are imported into the model for simulation. Under the preset rules of congestion, the agent-based model can effectively simulate the traffic conditions of each traffic intersection, and can induce backward the causes of traffic congestion using the simulation results and the Origin-Destination matrix. Finally, the model is used for the evaluation of road network optimization, which shows evident effects of the optimizing measures adopted in relieving congestion, and thus also proves the value of this method in urban studies.},

Revealing underlying dynamic patterns from these data is essential for understanding people{\textquoteright}s behavior and urban deployment. Spatio-temporal autocorrelation analysis is an exploratory approach to recognizing data distribution in space and time. The most widely used spatial autocorrelation measurements, such as Moran{\textquoteright}s I and local indicators of spatial association (LISA), only apply to static data, so are powerless to spatio-temporal big data about human mobility. Thus, we proposed a new method by extending Moran{\textquoteright}s I to measure the spatial autocorrelation of time series data. Then the method was applied to taxi ride data in Beijing, China to reveal the spatial pattern of collective human mobility. The result shows that there is strong positive spatio-temporal autocorrelation within the 5th Ring Road, weak negative spatio-temporal autocorrelation nearby the Sixth Ring Road, and almost no spatiotemporal autocorrelation between the roads. Local spatial patterns of taxi travel were also recognized. This method is useful for discovering underlying patterns from spatio-temporal big data to understand human mobility.},

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed the emergence of massive mobility data sets, such as tracks generated by GPS devices, call detail records, and geo-tagged posts from social media platforms. These data sets have fostered a vast scientific production on various applications of human mobility analysis, ranging from computational epidemiology to urban planning and transportation engineering. A strand of literature addresses data cleaning issues related to raw spatiotemporal trajectories, while the second line of research focuses on discovering the statistical "laws" that govern human movements. A significant effort has also been put on designing algorithms to generate synthetic trajectories able to reproduce, realistically, the laws of human mobility. Last but not least, a line of research addresses the crucial problem of privacy, proposing techniques to perform the re-identification of individuals in a database. Despite the increasing importance of human mobility analysis for many scientific and industrial domains, a view on state of the art cannot avoid noticing that there is no statistical software that can support scientists and practitioners with all the aspects mentioned above of mobility data analysis. To fill this gap, we propose scikit-mobility, a Python library that has the ambition of providing an environment to reproduce existing research, analyze mobility data, and simulate human mobility habits. scikit-mobility is efficient and easy to use as it extends the well-known standard pandas, a popular Python library for data analysis. Moreover, scikit-mobility provides the user with many functionalities, from visualizing trajectories to generating synthetic data, from analyzing the statistical patterns of trajectories to assessing the privacy risk related to the analysis of mobility data sets.},

	abstract = {The advancement of spatial information technology (SIT) boosts the location-based services (LBS) and smart urban applications. It brings the public into the era of smart society. Especially, by synthesizing of SIT, smartphones, and urban society, sharing economy mutualizing of goods and services to optimize the resource usage has boomed in recent years. In the transportation sector, transportation network companies (TNC) like Uber and Didi provide flexible and convenient on-demand sharing travel service for the public, thus have significantly changed urban mobility landscape. Taking the TNC vehicle GPS trajectories in Shenzhen as an example, this article presents a data-driven framework to uncover on-demand shared mobility pattern. The travels and stops are extracted from raw GPS trajectories using machine learning. Typical mobility patterns including sharing ridership, travel distance, and spatial communities are revealed. The results suggest that although most sharing travels are concentrated at downtown, a large proportional of LBS-based sharing travels appear at urban sub-centers. The distance of sharing travel follows the exponential distribution with the ?????? coefficient 0.15. The detected communities indicate the interaction derived from TNC vehicles are constrained by the administrative boundaries. These results suggest the advantages of travel sharing services in places where taxi services are not sufficient. These findings enable us to better understand the online sharing services and provide useful insights on the management of ride-sharing services in the city.},

This paper analyzes the feasibility of using mobile phone location signal data in earthquake emergency rescue work in several respects, such as quantity, location, change rate, and epicentral distance. The results show that mobile phone location signal data can quickly obtain the situation of personnel distribution and quantity after an earthquake, and we find the change rate, distance, etc., can determine the approximate range of the earthquake impact field. Through the data distribution in different time periods, the movement of personnel after the earthquake can be obtained. Based on several situations, we can determine the basic situation of the disaster-stricken areas in times after the earthquake, especially the personnel relevant to the situation, and these data can provide a scientific basis for emergency rescue decision making.},

The Ueno district, one of the most popular tourism destinations in Tokyo, Japan, was selected as the study area. For local stakeholders, the low accessibility levels between this district{\textquoteright}s park zone and downtown zone have become a major destination management issue. We compared visitor movements and flow networks in various places from different major trip origins (railway stations) by using several analysis techniques (GPS log distribution, spatial movement sequences, and network analysis), and examined physical and human factors that caused the different mobility patterns. The results demonstrated that physical factors, including major transport hubs (railway stations), topography, commercial accumulation, and POI distribution, affected intra-destination visitor behavior, and segmented visitor markets into different main zones. Such findings could inform future destination management policies and planning in local urban tourism destinations.},

In our basic scenario (\textit{R}$_{\textrm{0}}$ of 2{\textperiodcentered}68), mobility reduction of 20{\textendash}60\% within the city had a notable effect on controlling COVID-19 spread: a flattening of the peak number of cases by 33\% (95\% UI 21{\textendash}42) and delay to the peak number by 2 weeks with a 20\% restriction, 66\% (48{\textendash}75) reduction and 4 week delay with a 40\% restriction, and 91\% (79{\textendash}95) reduction and 14 week delay with a 60\% restriction. The effects of mobility restriction were increased when combined with reductions of 25\% or 50\% in transmissibility of the virus. In specific analyses of mobility restrictions for individuals with symptomatic infections and for high-risk regions, these measures also had substantial effects on reducing the spread of COVID-19. For example, the peak of the epidemic was delayed by 2 weeks if the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who could move freely was maintained at 20\%, and by 4 weeks if two high-risk regions were locked down.

While successfully mining human mobility data can benefit many applications such as city planning, transportation, urban economics, and public safety, it is very challenging to model large-scale Heterogeneous Human Mobility Data (HHMD) that are generated from different resources. In this paper, we develop a general collective learning approach to model HHMD at an individual level towards identifying and quantifying the urban forms of residential communities. Specifically, our proposed method exploits two geographic regularities among HHMD. First, we jointly capture the correlations among residential communities, urban functions, temporal effects, and user mobility patterns by analogizing communities as documents and mobility patterns as words. Also, we further combine explicit LASSO analysis and significant testing into latent representation learning as a regularization term by analogizing compatible Point-of-Interests (POIs) as the meta-data of communities. In this way, we can learn the urban forms, including a mix of functions and corresponding portfolios, of residential communities from HHDM and POIs. We further leverage these learned results to address two application problems: real estate ranking and restaurant popularity prediction. Finally, we conduct intensive evaluations with a variety of real-world data, where experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modeling method and its successful applications for other problems.},

	abstract = {In his classic book {\textquotedblleft}The Image of the City{\textquotedblright} Kevin Lynch used empirical work to show how different elements of the city were perceived: such as paths, landmarks, districts, edges, and nodes. Streets, by providing paths from which cities can be experienced, were argued to be one of the key elements of cities. Despite this long standing empirical basis, and the importance of Lynch's model in policy associated areas such as planning, work with user generated content has largely ignored these ideas. In this paper, we address this gap, using streets to aggregate filtered user generated content related to more than 1 million images and 60,000 individuals and explore similarity between more than 3000 streets in London across three dimensions: user behaviour, time and semantics. To perform our study we used two different sources of user generated content: (1) a collection of metadata attached to Flickr images and (2) street network of London from OpenStreetMap. We first explore global patterns in the distinctiveness and spatial autocorrelation of similarity using our three dimensions, establishing that the semantic and user dimensions in particular allow us to explore the city in different ways. We then used a Processing tool to interactively explore individual patterns of similarity across these four dimensions simultaneously, presenting results here for four selected and contrasting locations in London. Before drilling into the data to interpret in more detail, the identified patterns demonstrate that streets are natural units capturing perception of cities not only as paths but also through the emergence of other elements of the city proposed by Lynch including districts, landmarks and edges. Our approach also demonstrates how user generated content can be captured, allowing bottom-up perception from citizens to flow into a representation.},

	abstract = {Urban physical environments are the physical settings and built environments in neighbourhoods and cities which provide places for human activities. Evidence suggests that there are substantial associations between urban physical environments and various health outcomes, e.g. people{\textquoteright}s physical activities might be influenced by surrounding physical environments, thereby affecting their health behaviours; more exposure to urban physical environments may benefit human mental health. Street view imagery enables us to capture the landscape at eye-level, making it a promising data source for observing and analysing the realistic dynamics of urban physical environments. Compared with traditional in-person assessments and field observations, street view imagery-based data collection is relatively time-effective and cost-effective. Researchers from epidemiology, psychology, and geography have used street view imagery to quantify the built environment and understand its impacts on public health. To summarize current research trends, this paper systematically reviews the use of street view images for sensing urban environ- ments in public health studies. Specifically, we describe the characteristics of street view imagery and review the methodology for image processing and semantic understanding. We then sum- marize the challenges that remain for quantifying urban environments in terms of data and methodology. Several future research directions that would benefit public health research and practices are recommended in urban environment research.},

	abstract = {Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the United States have instituted regional strategies to encourage development around mixed use, higher density urban centers in response to air quality and transportation challenges. Because MPOs lack regulatory authority, these organizations have relied on voluntary approaches to coordinate regional planning for land use and transportation. While scholars have examined voluntary regional planning, there have been few studies of the urban centers concept. In Denver, Colorado, the MPO{\textquoteright}s Metro Vision plan promotes local adoption of centers supported through incentives. In this study, we examine whether existing conditions and future plans for centers support regional goals. Our approach relies on interviews and spatial data to categorize centers and evaluates whether each type of center is likely to achieve regional goals for transit, design, density, diversity, and destination. This work generated a typology of five center types: historic town centers, greenfield, industrial, commercial, and suburban mixed use. We find that the adopted centers fall short of meeting regional goals under existing conditions, but future plans for center types show promise. This typology offers more refined strategies and targeted incentives for other metropolitan regions considering a centers policy to support regional goals. There is also a need for better regional monitoring and improved indicators to assess progress.},

The first layer computes the middle-tier synopses at fine spatial and temporal scales, which are indexed and stored in a geodatabase. The second layer uses synopses to efficiently extract multiscale traffic patterns. The third layer supports real-time interactive visual analytics for intuitive explorations by end users. An experiment in Shenzhen on taxi GPS trajectories that were collected over one month was conducted. Multiple traffic patterns are recognized and visualized in real-time. The results show the satisfactory performance of proposed framework in traffic analysis, which will facilitate traffic management and operation.},

People with a wide range of individual demographic characteristics visit places at different weights and with different preferences, sculpting a city into a space of diverse spatial preferences. Due to the challenges in the collection and analysis of data considering multi-dimensional demographic characteristics, the daily movement of characterized individuals has been less studied. Therefore, we aim to develop a visual analytics system to better explore spatial preference based on individual demographic characteristics. We take a step forward and perform an online survey to collect individual profiles and movements from volunteers on a large-scale. Then, we design a visual analytic system to investigate the spatial preferences of groups by specifying demographic characteristics. To facilitate the identification of characterized groups, individuals are embedded in t-SNE projection for an abstract overview, and vivid graphics are drawn by a data-driven profile method for detailed examination. A 2.5D spatial visualization is proposed to maintain a compact multivariable analysis by relaxing the z-axis to encode information, such as visiting frequency, demands, and traveling distance. Together with a cross-filter and flexible 2.5D interactions, the effectiveness and usability of the system are demonstrated well by a study conducted in Shenzhen.},

The falling weight deflectometer (FWD) and the Benkelman beam deflectometer (BBD) are widely used in deflection measurement, and are suitable for measuring the elastic deflection of pavement under static loading or dynamic impact loading. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in continuous dynamic deflectometers, especially velocity-based deflectometers. The velocity-based continuous dynamic deflectometers, such as the laser dynamic deflectometer (LDD), are used to solve the problems of traffic speed and non-destructive pavement deflection measurement. However, there can be many deviations caused by the varied environmental parameters in practical application. In this article, through the review of the mechanism of the Euler-Bernoulli beam upon an elastic foundation and the corresponding influencing factors, the internal and external factors causing dynamic deflection measurement deviation are analyzed and summarized. The influences of pavement temperature, vehicle speed, pavement condition, and other factors are summarized and discussed. On this basis, a model of environmental parameter correction for the continuous dynamic deflectometer is established using a regression analysis method. Numbers of experiments confirmed the reliability of the correction model under different measurement conditions. The correlation experiments between the LDD and different types of deflectometer confirmed the accuracy of the correction model under different measurement conditions. The results showed that the correction model for the continuous deflection measurement of pavements under dynamic loads has strong robustness in different environments and conditions.},

The distributions of a wide variety of phenomena approximately follow scaling laws over a wide range of magnitudes, e.g., travel distance, spatial density, visitation frequency, etc. The spatial visitation frequency was confirmed following such empirical distributions, too, providing us a possibility for the spatial visitation prediction. This paper analyzes the scaling laws of dynamic spatial visitation frequencies using real on-demand ride service data from the platform of DiDi in Hangzhou, China. We predict the ranking of grids in terms of the densities of both points of interest (POIs) and different types of services provided by the platform (i.e., e-hailing taxi, DiDi Express, and Hitch). There are two main findings in the paper: Firstly, an exponential form of the scaling law does exist for the frequency{\textendash}ranking relationship with the DiDi dataset, which has not been discussed in the research area of on-demand ride services. Secondly, the spatial visitation prediction model is proposed to explain the importance of POIs variables and service variables in different time periods. The results show that the weighting of variables is positively related to its attractiveness. The findings indicate that our model has good interpretability while predicting spatial{\textendash}temporal arrivals with a high accuracy.},

However, spatio-temporal dependence, data variety, and the complexity of tasks impede an effective unit assessment. Inspired by the applications to extract critical image components based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), we propose a spatio-temporal layer-wise relevance propagation method to assess spatio-temporal units as a general solution. The method organizes input data into an extensible three-dimensional tensor form. We provide two means of labeling the spatio-temporal tensor data for typical geographical applications, using temporally or spatially relevant information. Neural network training proceeds to extract the global and local characteristics of data for corresponding analytical tasks. Then the method propagates classification results backward into units as obtained task-specific importance. A case study with taxi trajectory data in Beijing validates the method. The results prove that the proposed method can evaluate the task-specific importance of spatio-temporal units with dependence. This study also attempts to discover task-related knowledge using XAI.},

Here we perform a massive analysis on near{\textendash}real-time Italian mobility data provided by Facebook to investigate how lockdown strategies affect economic conditions of individuals and local governments. We model the change in mobility as an exogenous shock similar to a natural disaster. We identify two ways through which mobility restrictions affect Italian citizens. First, we find that the impact of lockdown is stronger in municipalities with higher fiscal capacity. Second, we find evidence of a segregation effect, since mobility contraction is stronger in municipalities in which inequality is higher and for those where individuals have lower income per capita. Our results highlight both the social costs of lockdown and a challenge of unprecedented intensity: On the one hand, the crisis is inducing a sharp reduction of fiscal revenues for both national and local governments; on the other hand, a significant fiscal effort is needed to sustain the most fragile individuals and to mitigate the increase in poverty and inequality induced by the lockdown.},

However, current GPS-equipped probe vehicles cannot directly provide us volume-related variables such as flow and density. In this paper, we propose a new probe vehicle-based estimation method for obtaining volume-related variables by assuming that a probe vehicle can measure the spacing to its leading one. This assumption can be realized by utilizing key technologies in advanced driver assistance systems that are expected to spread in the near future. We developed a method of estimating the flow, density, and speed from the probe vehicle data without exogenous assumptions on traffic flow characteristics, such as a fundamental diagram. In order to quantify the characteristics of the method, we performed a field experiment at a real-world urban expressway by employing prototypes of the probe vehicles with spacing measurement equipment. The result showed that the proposed method could accurately estimate the 5min and hourly traffic volumes with probe vehicle penetration rate of 3.5\% and 0.2\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {Green urban infrastructure, which serves the interests of both human and nature, are considered as essential assets of urban residents. However, measuring the use of green space has been problematic. Because, most previously used data on measuring green space use are self-reported or collected via social surveys, which not only include limited samples, but also are always subjective, costly, and laborious. This study integrates sensor and positioning technologies and measures the use of green space from an emerging big data perspective. The hourly real-time Tencent user density (RTUD) data from social media are used to analyze the time-spatial distribution of urban park users. RTUD data, park attributes, and surrounding landscape features are incorporated into ArcGIS for spatial analysis. A group of linear regression models is constructed to determine factors that may be associated with the user density of urban parks. The total accumulated number of observed users is 3.25 million in 686 urban parks of Shenzhen in two typical sunny days {\textendash} a work day and a rest day. Without costly and laborious field investigation, based on RTUD data, we conduct a city wide analysis regarding all parks. The proposed method is proved to be suitable for measuring urban green space use at city-level or even large scale. Results show that park user density is relatively high in well-developed areas and community parks. Park attributes and surrounding landscape features are significantly associated to park use. The findings of this study can help policy makers optimize the construction and maintenance of urban parks.},

The relationships between urban vibrancy and land-use configurations are significant for governments, planners and residents. To date, it is challenging for traditional census datasets to support real-time analysis with detailed spatial and temporal granularity. This article takes advantage of emerging crowdsourcing data and adopts social media check-ins over a 24-h period as a proxy for urban vibrancy. A framework that incorporates kernel density estimation (KDE), geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index (HHI) is proposed to explore the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of vibrancy and the spatio-temporal relationships with the influential factors. The results show that the evolution of vibrancy is influenced by various factors that are heterogeneous over space and time. With a new perspective and deeper understanding of the varying spatio-temporal relationships between vibrancy and point of interest (POI)-based configurations, this study can offers meaningful implications for policy makers and planners regarding the improvement of resource utilization and the rational design of neighbourhoods.},

Responding to this deficiency, this study integrated multi-source big data (WeChat users{\textquoteright} real-time location records, taxi GPS trajectories data, Points of Interest (POI) data, and building footprint data from high-resolution Quickbird images), and applied the proposed density-based method to infer the functions of urban buildings in Tianhe District, Guangzhou, China. The results of the study conformed to an overall detection rate of 72.22\%. When results were verified against ground-truth investigation data, the accuracy rate remained above 65\%. Two important conclusions can be drawn from our analysis: 1.The use of WeChat data delivers better inference results than those obtained using taxi data when used to identify residential buildings, offices, and urban villages. Conversely, shopping centers, hotels, and hospitals, were more easily identified using taxi data. 2. The use of integrated multi-source big data is more effective than single-source big data in revealing the relation between human dynamics and urban complexes at the building scale.},

	abstract = {The growing need of the driving public for accurate traffic information has spurred the deployment of large scale dedicated monitoring infrastructure systems, which mainly consist in the use of inductive loop detectors and video cameras. On-board electronic devices have been proposed as an alternative traffic sensing infrastructure, as they usually provide a cost-effective way to collect traffic data, leveraging existing communication infrastructure such as the cellular phone network. A traffic monitoring system based on GPS-enabled smartphones exploits the extensive coverage provided by the cellular network, the high accuracy in position and velocity measurements provided by GPS devices, and the existing infrastructure of the communication network. This article presents a field experiment nicknamed Mobile Century, which was conceived as a proof of concept of such a system. Mobile Century included 100 vehicles carrying a GPS-enabled Nokia N95 phone driving loops on a 10-mile stretch of I-880 near Union City, California, for 8h. Data were collected using virtual trip lines, which are geographical markers stored in the handset that probabilistically trigger position and speed updates when the handset crosses them. The proposed prototype system provided sufficient data for traffic monitoring purposes while managing the privacy of participants. The data obtained in the experiment were processed in real-time and successfully broadcast on the internet, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed system for real-time traffic monitoring. Results suggest that a 2{\textendash}3\% penetration of cell phones in the driver population is enough to provide accurate measurements of the velocity of the traffic flow.

	abstract = {The knowledge of the actual current state of the road traffic and its short-term evolution for the entire road network is a basic component of ATIS (advanced traveler information systems) and ATMS (advanced traffic management system) applications. In this view the use of real-time floating-car data (FCD), based on traces of GPS positions, is emerging as a reliable and cost-effective way to gather accurate travel times/speeds in a road network and to improve short-term predictions of travel conditions. The purpose of this paper is to present a large-scale working application of FCD-system, developed and operated by OCTOTelematics, delivering real-time traffic speed information throughout the Italian motorway network and along some important arterial streets located in major Italian metropolitan areas. Traffic speed estimates are deduced at an interval of 3 minutes from GPS traces transmitted in real-time from a large number (and still growing) of privately owned cars (about 600.000) equipped with a specific device covering a range of insurance-related applications. This paper also proposes two algorithms, respectively based on artificial neural networks and pattern-matching, designed to on-line perform short-term (15 to 30 minutes) predictions of link travel speeds by using current and near-past link average speeds estimated by the OCTOTelematics FCD system. The Rome ring road (GRA-Grande Raccordo Anulare) was used for testing the feasibility of the two algorithms. Testing results showed that the proposed approaches for short-term predictions are very promising and effective.},

The development of location-aware technology enables us to acquire large volume individual trajectories with different spatial and temporal resolution, such as GPS trajectories, mobile phone positioning data, social media check-in data, Wifi, and Bluetooth. However, the highest population penetrated mobile phone positioning trajectories are hard to infer human activity pattern directly, because of the sparsity in both space and time. This article presents a hierarchical clustering approach by using the move and stay sequences inferred from spare mobile phone trajectories to uncover the hidden human activity pattern. Personal stays at some places and following moves are first extracted from mobile phone trajectories, considering the spatial uncertainty of position. The similarity of trajectories is measured with a new indicator defined by the area of a spatial-temporal polygon bound with normalized trajectories. Finally, a hierarchical clustering method is developed to group trajectories with similar stay-move chains from the bottom to the top. The obtained clusters are analyzed to identify human activity patterns. An experiment with mobile phone users{\textquoteright} one-day trajectories in Shenzhen, China was conducted to test the performance of the proposed clustering approach. The results indicate all used trajectories are classified into 10 clusters representing typical daily activity patterns from the simple home-staying mode to complex home-working-social activity daily cycles. This study not only unravels the hidden activity patterns behind massive sparse trajectories but also deepens our understanding of the interaction of human activity and urban space.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Map-matching algorithms integrate positioning data with spatial road network data (roadway centrelines) to identify the correct link on which a vehicle is travelling and to determine the location of a vehicle on a link. A map-matching algorithm could be used as a key component to improve the performance of systems that support the navigation function of intelligent transport systems (ITS). The required horizontal positioning accuracy of such ITS applications is in the range of 1m to 40m (95\%) with relatively stringent requirements placed on integrity (quality), continuity and system availability. A number of map-matching algorithms have been developed by researchers around the world using different techniques such as topological analysis of spatial road network data, probabilistic theory, Kalman filter, fuzzy logic, and belief theory. The performances of these algorithms have improved over the years due to the application of advanced techniques in the map matching processes and improvements in the quality of both positioning and spatial road network data. However, these algorithms are not always capable of supporting ITS applications with high required navigation performance, especially in difficult and complex environments such as dense urban areas. This suggests that research should be directed at identifying any constraints and limitations of existing map matching algorithms as a prerequisite for the formulation of algorithm improvements. The objectives of this paper are thus to uncover the constraints and limitations by an in-depth literature review and to recommend ideas to address them. This paper also highlights the potential impacts of the forthcoming European Galileo system and the European Geostationary Overlay Service (EGNOS) on the performance of map matching algorithms. Although not addressed in detail, the paper also presents some ideas for monitoring the integrity of map-matching algorithms. The map-matching algorithms considered in this paper are generic and do not assume knowledge of {\textquoteleft}future{\textquoteright} information (i.e. based on either cost or time). Clearly, such data would result in relatively simple map-matching algorithms.},

In this paper, deep neural network-based approaches are presented to label urban land use at pixel level using high-resolution aerial images and ground-level street view images. We use a deep neural network to extract semantic features from sparsely distributed street view images and interpolate them in the spatial domain to match the spatial resolution of the aerial images, which are then fused together through a deep neural network for classifying land use categories. Our methods are tested on a large publicly available aerial and street view images dataset of New York City, and the results show that using aerial images alone can achieve relatively high classification accuracy, the ground-level street view images contain useful information for urban land use classification, and fusing street image features with aerial images can improve classification accuracy. Moreover, we present experimental studies to show that street view images add more values when the resolutions of the aerial images are lower, and we also present case studies to illustrate how street view images provide useful auxiliary information to aerial images to boost performances.},

Using employment data including more than 100 million U.S. workers in all industries between 1998 and 2013, we empirically show that individual cities indeed recapitulate a common pathway where a transition to innovative economies is observed at the population of 1.2 million. This critical population is analytically derived by expressing the urban industrial structure as a function of scaling relations such that cities are divided into two economic categories: small city economies with sublinear industries and large city economies with superlinear industries. Last, we define a recapitulation score as an agreement between the longitudinal and the cross-sectional scaling exponents and find that nontradeable industries tend to adhere to the universal pathway more than the tradeable.

Existing gridded population projections under the SSPs have relatively coarse resolution and issue of overestimation in populated areas, which further bias the analysis of climate change impacts. In this study, we proposed a scheme by integrating high-resolution historical population maps and machine learning models to predict future built-up land and population distributions, which were rendered consistent with the SSPs. Using this proposed method in China, we generated a set of 100-m SSPs population maps for China from 2015 to 2050 at 5-year intervals. Our projections revealed different spatial structures for the population distribution at the grid level and three modes of provincial population change across the five SSPs from 2015 to 2050. By applying the 100-m SSPs population grids, we showed that, from 2015 to 2050, exposure to extreme heat in China will increase by 121{\textendash}136\% and 164{\textendash}191\% under the representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5, respectively. We also found a severe spatial bias in the existing 1/8 {\textdegree} SSPs population grids, i.e., 30{\textendash}43\% of the estimated population is wrongly allocated in cropland, forest, and pastureland. This bias results in substantial underestimation of extreme heat exposure in high-density metropolitan areas and overestimation in medium and low-density areas.},

	abstract = {Conventional facility planning seeks to provide service facilities to meet population demand in an aggregate manner. However, recent studies reveal that the provision of facilities in residential neighborhoods does not necessarily mean easy service access for certain groups. This issue is approached through the lens of space{\textendash}time constraints in this study, which asserts that because people with different socioeconomic attributes experience different space{\textendash}time constraints, the effects of the same built environment on actual access can considerably vary. Based on the activity-diary data from 493 respondents in Guangzhou, China, this study conducts a quasi-experiment facilitated by the propensity score matching approach. Residents in low-density suburban areas and those in high-density central city areas are considered as the control and treatment groups, respectively. By comparing the activity-travel behavior between these two groups, this work presents an analysis of the effects of service density improvement on residents{\textquoteright} actual service access. Moreover, the differences of such effects are examined through separate quasi-experiments for residents with the largest, medium and smallest space{\textendash}time constraints. Residents who originally experience the smallest space{\textendash}time constraints could further benefit from the enhancement of service density, whereas those who originally suffer from the largest and medium space{\textendash}time constraints could not. These findings imply that conventional facility planning may not provide equitable outcomes. Therefore, facility planning and management should address and integrate residents{\textquoteright} unequal experiences of space{\textendash}time constraints into time-sensitive policies (e.g., flextime policies).},

To understand the impact of surging housing prices on the low-to-moderate income group, this study uses transit smart card data to explore whether and to what extent increasing housing affordability pressure impacts the pattern of residential spatial distribution. This analysis is based on the facts that most public transit commuters are in the low-to-moderate income group and that transit smart cards continuously record individual spatial choice behaviors. Compared with conventional approaches using census data or survey data, our approach can more quickly detect residential changes. Experimental results indicated that most low-to-moderate income dwellers lived in low-housing-cost areas with high accessibility to public transportation. Three relocation patterns were discovered based on significant changes in residential spatial distribution. The overall pattern is to move from the inner city to suburban areas or to the urban periphery, where housing costs are much lower. Specifically, these commuters moved along traffic corridors (metro lines), which indicates that their residential choices were constrained by employment locations and public transport facilities. Finally, these commuters presented a jumping relocation pattern along metro lines due to the search for low-rent housing. Our findings provide some insights into urban dynamics, as well as urban and housing policies.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an increasing use of big data in mobility research. Such efforts have led to many insights on the travel behavior and activity patterns of people. Despite these achievements, the data veracity issue and its impact on the processes of knowledge discovery have seldom been discussed. In this research, we investigate the veracity issue of mobile signaling data (MSD) when they are used to characterize human mobility patterns. We first discuss the location uncertainty issues in MSD that would hinder accurate estimations of human mobility patterns, followed by an examination of two existing methods for addressing these issues (clustering-based method and time window{\textendash}based method). We then propose a new approach that can overcome some of the limitations of these two methods. By applying all three methods to a large-scale mobile signaling data set, we find that the choice of preprocessing methods could lead to changes in the data characteristics. Such changes, which are nontrivial, will further affect the characterization and interpretation of human mobility patterns. By computing four mobility indicators (number of origin{\textendash}destination trips, number of activity locations, total stay time, and activity entropy) from the outputs of the three methods, we illustrate their varying impacts on individual mobility estimations relevant to location uncertainty issues. Our analysis results call for more attention to the veracity issue in data-driven mobility research and its implications for replicability and reproducibility of geospatial research.},

This study analyzes cab drivers' stay behaviors using a taxi GPS trajectory dataset collected in Wuhan, China. By extracting cab drivers' stay activities from the dataset, we measure the activity frequency at the level of traffic analysis zones (TAZs) and examine their spatiotemporal dynamics. We then derive several built environment indicators and assess their associations with these activities using ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models. According to the results, the stay frequency decays dramatically over the TAZs, indicating that these activities tend to be concentrated in particular areas of the city. The rates of decay, as reflected by the rank-size and power-law distributions, are similar on weekdays and weekends. Cab drivers' stay activities exhibit similar spatial patterns during the same period on weekdays and weekends. The adjusted R-squared of OLS is 0.742 for weekdays and 0.676 for weekends, which suggests a close relationship between stay activities and built environment characteristics. The GWR models further reveal the spatial variations of the activity-environment linkage across the study area.

The accessibility of each phone user is evaluated using fine spatial resolution across the entire city. The impacts of human mobility on accessibility are quantified by using relative accessibility ratios between phone users and a virtual stationary user in the same residential location. Results of this study enrich understandings of how land use influences relationships between human mobility and accessibility. For resource-poor regions with sparse service facilities, human mobility can greatly enhance individual accessibility. In contrast, for resource-rich regions with dense service facilities, human mobility can even reduce individual accessibility. Overall, human mobility can reduce spatial inequity of accessibility for people living in different regions of the city. The results of this study also have several important methodological implications for including human mobility and time dimension in accessibility evaluations.},

The proposed approach develops an interdisciplinary and quantitative framework to understand mobility characteristics in urban areas. The paper explores statistical properties of the complex weighted network of urban trips of the selected cities. We show that travel demand networks exhibit similar properties despite their differences in topography and urban structure. Results provide a quantitative characterization of the network structure of origin{\textendash}destination demand in cities, suggesting that the underlying dynamical processes in travel demand networks are similar and evolved by the distribution of activities and interaction between places in cities.},

	abstract = {Datasets collecting the ever-changing position of moving individuals are usually big and possess high spatial and temporal resolution to reveal activity patterns of individuals in greater detail. Information about human mobility, such as {\textquoteleft}when, where and why people travel{\textquoteright}, is contained in these datasets and is necessary for urban planning and public policy making. Nevertheless, how to segregate the users into groups with different movement and behaviours and generalise the patterns of groups are still challenging. To address this, this article develops a theoretical framework for uncovering space-time activity patterns from individual{\textquoteright}s movement trajectory data and segregating users into subgroups according to these patterns. In this framework, individuals{\textquoteright} activities are modelled as their visits to spatio-temporal region of interests (ST-ROIs) by incorporating both the time and places the activities take place. An individual{\textquoteright}s behaviour is defined as his/her profile of time allocation on the ST-ROIs she/he visited. A hierarchical approach is adopted to segregate individuals into subgroups based upon the similarity of these individuals{\textquoteright} profiles. The proposed framework is tested in the analysis of the behaviours of London foot patrol police officers based on their GPS trajectories provided by the Metropolitan Police.},

This article analyzes the theories and methods of big data in traffic demand forecasting. In view of theory, the new models and algorithms are proposed in order to adapt to new big data and response to the limitations of traditional disaggregated approaches. In such approaches, three traffic demand-forecasting methods, the full sample-demand distribution model, the traffic integration model, the model organism protein expression database model, are discussed. Undoubtedly, the development of big data also presents new challenges to travel-demand forecasting methods regarding data acquisition, data processing, data analysis, and application of results. In particular, identifying how to improve approaches to traffic-demand forecasting in the big data era in the Third World will be a challenge to the researchers in the field.},

	abstract = {Understanding urban functions and their relationships with human activities has great implications for smart and sustainable urban development. In this study, we present a novel approach to uncovering urban functions by aggregating human activities inferred from mobile phone positioning and social media data. First, the homes and workplaces (of travelers) are estimated from mobile phone positioning data to annotate the activities conducted at these locations. The remaining activities (such as shopping, schooling, transportation, recreation and entertainment) are labeled using a hidden Markov model with social knowledge learned from social media check-in data over a lengthy period. By aggregating identified human activities, hourly urban functions are inferred, and the diurnal dynamics of those functions are revealed. An empirical analysis was conducted for the case of Shenzhen, China. The results indicate that the proposed approach can capture citywide dynamics of both human activities and urban functions. It also suggests that although many urban areas have been officially labeled with a single land-use type, they may provide different functions over time depending on the types and range of human activities. The study demonstrates that combining different data on human activities could yield an improved understanding of urban functions, which would benefit short-term urban decision-making and long-term urban policy making.},

We map the points of the interface formed at each time into a graph by means of a visibility algorithm. As the corresponding interfaces grow, their visibility graphs change over time. We show that the visibility graphs are all scale free for each time. We use the variance of the node degrees as a measure of the dynamical properties of these graphs. This magnitude reveals an unexpected scaling behaviour of these graphs in both the number of nodes and time. This enables to define three robust exponents that characterize any type of dynamics with more detail than the classical scaling analysis applied directly to the physical interfaces. To check the feasibility of this approach we study and classify six different dynamical processes and estimate their critical exponents. We conclude that the dynamics of physical systems far from equilibrium can be determined by its corresponding visibility network. Indeed, this methodology is able to discern among dynamical processes that hitherto have been classified in the same universality class according to the scaling analysis of their interfaces.},

We explain this outcome as arising from the attenuation of urban agglomeration effects at greater distances and incomplete commuting and migration responses to lower labor demand in rural areas. One implication is that remote areas may particularly experience greater reductions in poverty from place-based economic development policies.},

Many studies try to semantically enrich mobility data with annotations about human activities. However, these approaches either focus on places with high frequencies (e.g., home and work), or relay on background knowledge (e.g., public available points of interest). In this paper, we depart from the concept of frequency and we focus on a high level representation of mobility using network analytics. The visits of each driver to each systematic destination are modeled as links in a bipartite network where a set of nodes represents drivers and the other set represents places. We extract such network from two real datasets of human mobility based, respectively, on GPS and GSM data. We introduce the concept of mobility complexity of drivers and places as a ranking analysis over the nodes of these networks. In addition, by means of community discovery analysis, we differentiate subgroups of drivers and places according both to their homogeneity and to their mobility complexity.},

	abstract = {Towards the end of the twentieth century, polycentricity was introduced into China as a planning concept. Subsequently a number of super/mega city regions began to adopt polycentric development spatial planning strategies, which are designed to facilitate more sustainable and balanced development. This paper seeks to identify the main differences in application of polycentricity between China and the West, and explore the major emerging thematic strands of polycentric development practice, as illustrated through an evaluation of master planning in eight super/mega city regions across China. In particular, the paper highlights the divergent interpretations of polycentricity in master plan-making practice and shows how plans have been adjusted to help deliver the idea of polycentric development. Although the concept of polycentricity is relatively new in China, it has already become a normative approach used to determine future spatial structures. While there is an absence of an articulated rationality to {\textquoteleft}decide{\textquoteright} whether this is (or should be) an {\textquoteleft}ideal{\textquoteright} model, already it has gone beyond Western approaches of initially using polycentricity as an interpretative tool to describe urban realities.},

In addition, we compare the spatial configurations of three regional urban networks: the Pearl River Delta, the Yangzi River Delta and the Bohai Rim. The outcomes show that the three functional regions connected by HSR are the most dominant polycentric regions in China and that the Bohai Rim is less hierarchical than the other two.

	abstract = {The San Francisco Bay Area has taken on a distinct polycentric metropolitan form, with three tiers of hierarchical employment centers encircling downtown San Francisco, the region's primary center. In this paper it is found that polycentric development is associated with differentials in suburban and urban commute trip times: commute trips made by employees of suburban centers are shorter in duration than commute trips made by their counterparts in larger and denser urban centers. Differentials were even greater, however, with respect to commuting modal splits. Lower density, outlying employment centers averaged far higher rates of drive-alone automobile commuting and insignificant levels of transit commuting. Smaller, outlying centers were also the least self-contained, with a large number averaging twenty or more times as many external as internal commutes. The effects of housing availability and prices on the residential locational choices of those working both in urban and in suburban employment centers are also investigated in this paper. Locational choices are stratified by occupational class and type of center. High housing prices in and around employment centers were found to displace workers to residences in other subregions, except in the case of professional workers in fast-growing, outlying centers. These workers were attracted to higher-priced nearby housing. In the empirical analysis, significant segmentation in housing choices among workers in fast-growing suburban centers was found. This could be partly due to selective land-use policies implemented by local governments in these areas.},

	abstract = {From the normative perspective of EU regional policy, polycentric spatial development has been seen as an effective tool to overcome regional disparities since the adoption of the European Spatial Development Perspective. However, the impact of a polycentric spatial structure on equal spatial development is ambiguous and still waits for its clarification. This paper examines the relationship by focusing on the local scale, where medium-sized towns play a crucial role as local centres in everyday human lives. Using functional regions of the Czech Republic, this paper defines polycentric urban systems at the micro-regional scale. Subsequently, the level of mono/polycentricity is compared with intra-regional disparities. Based on the results of the analysis, it can be argued that the connection of polycentricity with balanced spatial development is strongly determined by selected indicators. However, the findings do not provide evidence about the strictly positive impact of polycentricity on intra-regional disparities. In a light of these results, the conclusion is rather sceptical about the unique role of polycentricity in spatial development and due to the lack of similar studies, further research is recommended.},

	abstract = {It is meaningful to analyze urban spatial structure by identifying urban subcenters, and many methods of doing so have been proposed in the published literature. Although these methods are widely applied, they exhibit obvious shortcomings that limit their further application. Therefore, it is of great value to propose a new urban subcenter identification method that can overcome these shortcomings. In this paper, we propose the density contour tree (DCT) method for detecting urban polycentric structures and their spatial distributions. Conceptually, this method is based on an analogy between urban spatial structure and terrain. The point-of-interest (POI) density is visualized as a continuous mathematical surface representing the urban terrain. Peaks represent the regions of the most frequent human activity, valleys represent regions with small population densities in the city, and slopes represent spatial changes in urban land-use intensity. Using this method, we have detected the urban \&ldquo;polycentric\&rdquo; structure of Beijing and determined the corresponding spatial relationships. In addition, several important properties of the urban centers have been identified. For example, Beijing has a typical urban polycentric structure with an urban center area accounting for 5.9\% of the total urban area, and most of the urban centers in Beijing serve comprehensive functions. In general, the method and the results can serve as references for the later research on analyzing urban structure.},

	abstract = {This paper examines road freight transport activity and its relationship with facility location, logistics management and urban form through an analysis of 14 selected urban areas in the UK. Improved understanding of this relationship will assist planners when making transport and land use decisions. The findings suggest that several geographical, spatial and land use factors have important influences on freight activity in urban areas. Commercial and industrial land use patterns affect the types and quantities of goods produced, consumed, and hence the total quantity of freight transport handled. This also influences the distances over which goods are moved and by what specific mode. There has been relatively low growth in warehousing in many of the selected areas over the last decade compared to the national average as well suburbanisation of warehousing in some locations. This affects the origin and destination of journeys visiting these facilities and typically increases the distance of such journeys. A greater proportion of road freight has been shown to be lifted on internal journeys in large urban areas than in smaller ones. Journeys within urban areas have been shown to be less efficient than journeys to and from the urban area in the 14 locations studied due to the much smaller average vehicle carrying capacities and lower lading factors for journeys within urban areas. The length of haul on journeys to and from urban areas studied was found to be greatest for those areas with a major seaport and/or which were geographically remote. This affects the road freight transport intensity of goods transport journeys.},

Cities are highly integrated within an urban agglomeration, which renders the agglomeration one of the most important carriers for global economic development.

The objective of this article is to provide a review of complex network theory in urban land-use and transport studies to date. Some traditional integrated studies of urban land-use and traffic networks are summarized and analysed; related research gaps were proposed. Then, this paper reviewed the application of complex network theory in urban land-use and transport research and practice. It shows that the node importance identification method is critical for network protection or attack studies; the multiple centrality assessment and kernel density estimation approaches can be used to represent the intuitionistic connections of urban traffic networks and surrounding land-uses; it can be used to verify the changing trend and variation of landscape connectivity; also it can be applied to the identification of key changed land-use types in land-use cover change; the coevolution process can be treated as an integrated way to discuss the relationships between urban traffic network growth and land-use change, and the multilayer networks based analysis is a novel method to measure their interactions. This paper is essential in establishing apparent research interests and points out the further potential application of complex network theory in urban traffic network and land-use related studies.},

By integrating open data from Lianjia.com, Dianping.com, Mobike.com, and Baidu Map POI, we analyze spatial patterns of apartment prices and their association with local attributes in Shanghai. We find that Shanghai's residential market still has a monocentric structure because of the centralized distribution of public transport facilities and amenities. Hedonic models further confirm that structural attributes, accessibility, as well as public and private service amenities significantly shape the real estate market. These factors also are differentiated so as to form a pattern of concentric rings. In the inner-city and expanded inner-city areas, public service amenities such as parks, schools, hospitals, and banks, as well as private service amenities such as entertainment, shopping, and residential service facilities, boost housing prices. In the suburbs, better access to bike sharing, bus stops, and metro stations are the top preferences for apartment buyers. Our study also indicates that the Chinese government needs to make public and private services more accessible, not only spatially in urban peripheries and villages, but also institutionally to lower income families who cannot afford apartments in expensive neighborhoods.},

Here we investigate the communication patterns in 2 social Internet communities in search of statistical laws in human interaction activity. This research reveals that human communication networks dynamically follow scaling laws that may also explain the observed trends in economic growth. Specifically, we identify a generalized version of Gibrat's law of social activity expressed as a scaling law between the fluctuations in the number of messages sent by members and their level of activity. Gibrat's law has been essential in understanding economic growth patterns, yet without an underlying general principle for its origin. We attribute this scaling law to long-term correlation patterns in human activity, which surprisingly span from days to the entire period of the available data of more than 1 year. Further, we provide a mathematical framework that relates the generalized version of Gibrat's law to the long-term correlated dynamics, which suggests that the same underlying mechanism could be the source of Gibrat's law in economics, ranging from large firms, research and development expenditures, gross domestic product of countries, to city population growth. These findings are also of importance for designing communication networks and for the understanding of the dynamics of social systems in which communication plays a role, such as economic markets and political systems.},

Specifically, the degree of an individual is entirely random - following a {\textquotedblleft}maximum entropy attachment{\textquotedblright} model - except for its mean value which depends deterministically on the volume of the users' activity.

	abstract = {Big Data offer nowadays the potential capability of creating a digital nervous system of our society, enabling the measurement, monitoring and prediction of relevant aspects of socio-economic phenomena in quasi real time. This potential has fueled, in the last few years, a growing interest around the usage of Big Data to support official statistics in the measurement of individual and collective economic well-being. In this work we study the relations between human mobility patterns and socioeconomic development. Starting from nation-wide mobile phone data we extract a measure of mobility volume and a measure of mobility diversity for each individual. We then aggregate the mobility measures at municipality level and investigate the correlations with external socio-economic indicators independently surveyed by an official statistics institute. We find three main results. First, aggregated human mobility patterns are correlated with these socio-economic indicators. Second, the diversity of mobility, defined in terms of entropy of the individual users' trajectories, exhibits the strongest correlation with the external socio-economic indicators. Third, the volume of mobility and the diversity of mobility show opposite correlations with the socioeconomic indicators. Our results, validated against a null model, open an interesting perspective to study human behavior through Big Data by means of new statistical indicators that quantify and possibly "nowcast" the socio-economic development of our society.},

	abstract = {Urban functional area (UFA) recognition is one of the most important strategies for achieving sustainable city development. As remote-sensing and social-sensing data sources have increasingly become available, UFA recognition has received a significant amount of attention. Research on UFA recognition that uses a single dataset suffers from a low update frequency or low spatial resolution, while data fusion-based methods are limited in efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposes an integrated model to identify UFA using satellite images and taxi global positioning system (GPS) trajectories in four steps. First, blocks were generated as spatial units in the study area, and the spatiotemporal information entropy of the taxi GPS trajectory (STET) for each block was calculated. Second, a 24-hour time-frequency series was formed based on the pick-up and drop-off points extracted from taxi trajectories and used as the interpretation indicator of the blocks. The K-Means++ and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm were used to identify their social functions. Third, a multilabel classification method based on the residual neural network (MLC-ResNets) and \&ldquo;You Only Look Once\&rdquo; (YOLO) target detection algorithms were used to identify the features of the typical and atypical spatial textures, respectively, of the satellite images in the blocks. The confidence scores of the features of the blocks were categorized by the decision tree algorithm. Fourth, to find the best way to integrate the two sub-models for UFA identification, the 10-fold cross-validation method based on stratified random sampling was applied to determine the most optimal STET thresholds. The results showed that the average accuracy reached 82.0\%, with an average kappa of 73.5\%\&mdash;significant improvements over most existing studies. This paper provides new insights into how the advantages of satellite images and taxi trajectories in UFA identification can be fully exploited to support sustainable city management.},

In this study, we produced a series of climate type map of China at 0.1\&deg; resolution from 1979 to 2018 using K{\"o}ppen-Geiger climate classification, which provided continuous fine-scale decadal climate classification data for climate researches in China. Based on these climate maps, we divided China into four main climate zones: arid climate zone located on the north of Tibetan Plateau and west of Inner Mongolian Plateau, temperate climate zones in southern China, cold climate zone occupied most of Northeast Plain and North China Plain, and polar climate zone on Tibetan Plateau. The distribution of main climate classes in China have not changed significantly over 40 years, while the climate change mainly occurs at the levels of climate type and subtype changes. The frequency of climate changes shows the climate sensitivity of the region, and we identified the transition areas of climate zones with a high sensitivity to climate change. The change of climate types shows an obvious trend of rising temperature in all climate zones of China and increasing precipitation in most climate zones of China (the cold climate zone shows no significant dry or wet change). Overall, the climate in China is generally getting warmer and wetter in the past 40 years. Furthermore, we analysed the landscape responses on climate change with land cover data, e.g. the vegetation type variations in southern China and the snow cover fluctuations on Tibetan Plateau.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A new urban planning paradigm must be at the heart of our road map for the years to come, the one where, within minutes, inhabitants can access their basic living needs by bike or by foot. In this work, we present novel insights of the interplay between the distributions of facilities and population that maximize accessibility over the existing road networks. Results in six cities reveal that travel costs could be reduced in half through redistributing facilities. In the optimal scenario, the average travel distance can be modeled as a functional form of the number of facilities and the population density. As an application of this finding, it is possible to estimate the number of facilities needed for reaching a desired average travel distance given the population distribution in a city.
Interplay between facilities and population in cities is studied and a universal function is found to model optimal accessibility.

	abstract = {Social Sensing and Big Data Computing for Disaster Management captures recent advancements in leveraging social sensing and big data computing for supporting disaster management. Specifically, analysed within this book are some of the promises and pitfalls of social sensing data for disaster relevant information extraction, impact area assessment, population mapping, occurrence patterns, geographical disparities in social media use, and inclusion in larger decision support systems.

Traditional data collection methods such as remote sensing and field surveying often fail to offer timely information during or immediately following disaster events. Social sensing enables all citizens to become part of a large sensor network which is low cost, more comprehensive, and always broadcasting situational awareness information. However, data collected with social sensing is often massive, heterogeneous, noisy, and unreliable in some aspects. It comes in continuous streams, and often lacks geospatial reference information. Together, these issues represent a grand challenge toward fully leveraging social sensing for emergency management decision making under extreme duress. Meanwhile, big data computing methods and technologies such as high-performance computing, deep learning, and multi-source data fusion become critical components of using social sensing to understand the impact of and response to the disaster events in a timely fashion.

This book was originally published as a special issue of the International Journal of Digital Earth.

	abstract = {Location-aware technologies and big data are transforming the ways we capture and analyze human activities. This has particularly affected tourism geography, which aims to study tourist activities within the context of space and places. In this study, we argue that the tourism geography of cities can be better understood through the time use of tourists captured by fine-grained human mobility observations. By using a large-scale mobile phone data set collected in three cities in South Korea (Gangneung, Jeonju, and Chuncheon), we develop a computational framework to enable accurate quantification of tourist time use, the visualization of their spatiotemporal activity patterns, and systematic comparisons across cities. The framework consists of several approaches for the extraction and semantic labeling of tourist activities, visual-analytic tools (time use diagram, time{\textendash}activity diagram) for examining their time use, as well as quantitative measures that facilitate day-to-day comparisons. The feasibility of the framework is demonstrated by performing a comparative analysis in three cities during representative days when tourists tended to show more regular patterns. The framework is also employed to examine tourist time use during special events, using Gangneung during the 2018 Winter Olympics (WO) as an example. The findings are validated by comparing the spatiotemporal patterns with the WO calendar of events. The study provides a new perspective that connects time geography and tourism through the usage of spatiotemporal big data. The computational framework can be applied to compatible data sets to advance time geography, tourism, and urban mobility research.},

Understanding the causes behind this phenomenon is of great significance for urban space optimization. Various spatial big data make possible the fine description of urban residents travel behaviors, and bring new approaches to related studies. The present study focuses on two aspects: one is to obtain relatively accurate features of commuting behaviors by using mobile phone data, and the other is to simulate commuting behaviors of residents through the agent-based model and inducing backward the causes of congestion. Taking the Baishazhou area of Wuhan, a local area of a mega city in China, as a case study, travel behaviors of commuters are simulated: the spatial context of the model is set up using the existing urban road network and by dividing the area into travel units; then using the mobile phone call detail records (CDR) of a month, statistics of residents' travel during the four time slots in working day mornings are acquired and then used to generated the OD matrix of travels at different time slots; and then the data are imported into the model for simulation. By the preset rules of congestion, the agent-based model can effectively simulate the traffic conditions of each traffic intersection, and can also induce backward the causes of traffic congestion using the simulation results and the OD matrix. Finally, the model is used for the evaluation of road network optimization, which shows evident effects of the optimizing measures adopted in relieving congestion, and thus also proves the value of this method in urban studies.},

It is plausible that these trends are contributing to regional accessibility inequalities, though quantitative research testing this link is limited. This paper examines differences in employment accessibility between Standard Occupational Classification groups in the London Metropolitan Region for 2011 for car, transit, bus only and walking modes. Additionally, changes in occupational class populations 2006{\textendash}2016 are considered, revealing continuing inner-city gentrification. Employment accessibility is calculated using cumulative measures, based on travel times from multi-modal network modelling. The results show that while car accessibility is relatively equal between occupational classes, public transport, bus and walk accessibility have significant inequalities favouring professional classes. Low income groups have lower accessibility for the most affordable bus and walk modes, and inequalities are greater for residents in the wider metropolitan region. Furthermore, professional groups combine accessibility advantages with the highest rates of owner occupation, maximising housing wealth benefits. Lower income groups are exposed to rent increases, though this is offset by social housing, which remains the most prevalent tenure in Inner London for low income classes.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of the social impacts of transport policies is attracting growing attention in recent years. Yet, this literature is still predominately focused on developed countries. The goal of this research is to investigate how investments in public transport networks can reshape social and geographical inequalities in access to opportunities in a developing country, using the city of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) as a case study. Recent mega-events, including the 2014 Football World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games, have triggered substantial investment in the city{\textquoteright}s transport system. More recently, though, bus services in Rio have been rationalized and reduced as a response to a fiscal crisis and a drop in passenger demand, giving a unique opportunity to look at the distributional effects this cycle of investment and disinvestment have had on peoples{\textquoteright} access to educational and employment opportunities. Based on a before-and-after comparison of Rio{\textquoteright}s public transport network, this study uses a spatial regression model and cluster analysis to estimate how accessibility gains vary across different income groups and areas of the city between April 2014 and March 2017. The results show that recent cuts in service levels have offset the potential benefits of newly added public transport infrastructure in Rio. Average access by public transport to jobs and public high-schools decreased approximately 4\% and 6\% in the period, respectively. Nonetheless, wealthier areas had on average small but statistically significant higher gains in access to schools and job opportunities than poorer areas. These findings suggest that, contrary to the official discourses of transport legacy, recent transport policies in Rio have exacerbated rather than reduced socio-spatial inequalities in access to opportunities.},

	abstract = {Digital footprints collected from social media platforms are often clustered using methods such as the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and its variants to identify daily travel activities (e.g., dwelling, working, entertainment, and eating). However, these clustering methods mostly only consider the spatial distribution of travel activity points while ignoring their geographic context, resulting in the aggregation of digital footprints representing different activity types into one cluster. In addition, existing works only focus on examining people's travel activities at either the collective (i.e., macro) or individual (i.e., micro) level. To this end, this study utilizes geographic context information and develops a novel activity knowledge discovery framework to better detect frequent travel activities at both levels. First, we develop a multi-level spatial clustering method to aggregate digital footprints of a group of users into collective clusters (i.e., activity zones) by inferring and integrating the underlying activities performed at each zone with OpenStreetMap (OSM) datasets that can inform geographic context of the activity zones. Next, we introduce a location-aware clustering method to detect activity zones and associate activity types at the individual level by aggregating individual footprints based on the collective results. As case studies, digital footprints from 49 selected Twitter users are analyzed to evaluate the proposed framework. The results reveal that: (1) The multi-level spatial clustering method can often detect significant collective activity zones; and (2) The location-aware clustering method can aggregate individual digital footprints into activity zones more effectively compared with existing density-based spatial clustering methods (e.g., DBSCAN).},

	abstract = {In the US, people spend more than 90\% of their time in buildings, which contributes to more than 70\% of overall electricity usage in the country. Occupant behavior is becoming a leading factor impacting energy consumption in buildings. Existing occupant-behavior studies are often limited to a single building and individual behavior, such as presence or interactions in confined spaces. Moreover, studies modeling occupant behavior at the building or community level are limited. With the development of the Internet of Things, mobile positioning data are available through social media and location-based service applications. The goal of this study is to analyze the impacts of more representative occupancy profiles, derived from high resolution urban scale mobile position data, on building energy consumption. . A pilot study was conducted on more than 900 buildings in downtown San Antonio, Texas, with billions of mobile positioning data. We then compared these profiles with the existing Department of Energy prototype models and quantified the differences using a statistical method. On average, the differences in occupancy rates between the ones derived from the empirical profile and the ones from the Department of Energy reference ranged from -30\% to 70\%. The realistic derived profiles are then simulated in the CityBES. The results show that the predicted cooling energy demand is reduced by up to 40\% while the heating energy demand is reduced by up to 60\%. This study, therefore, advances knowledge of urban planning as well as urban-scale energy modeling and optimization.},

Previous studies have decomposed urban land areas using either remote sensing images or geospatial big data. Few studies have combined these two data sources because of the lack of methodologies. This article proposed an end-to-end two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) for combining features (CF-CNN) to estimate the proportion of mixed land use by integrating high spatial resolution (HSR) images and geospatial big data of real-time Tencent user density (RTUD) data. Two deep learning networks, one for image information extraction and other for human activity-related information extraction, are used to construct two branches of CF-CNN. The mixed land use can be described by calculating the proportions of each land use type at the street-block level. Compared with methods for using single-source data, CF-CNN obtained the highest classification accuracy. We further applied the Shannon diversity index (SHDI) to quantify the agglomerated urban mixed land use. The Spearman correlation coefficients among the SHDI, community distance, and neighborhood vibrancy were calculated to verify the effectiveness of the mixed land use composition. Our framework provided an alternative way of identifying mixed land use structures by integrating multisource data.},

This interdisciplinary theoretical formulation details our evidence-based interpretation of how smart city transitions should be conceptualized and enacted in order to overcome the oversimplification fallacy resulting from corporate discourses on smart urbanism. By offering a broad and realistic understanding of smart city transitions, the proposed theory combines different smart-city-related concepts in a model which attempts to expose what causal mechanisms surface in sustainable smart city transitions and to guide empirical inquiry in smart city research. Together with all the authors contributing to this Special Issue, our objective is to give smart city research more robust scientific foundations and to generate theoretical propositions upon which subsequent large-scale empirical testing can be conducted. With the proposed middle-range theory, different empirical settings can be investigated by using the same analytical elements, facilitating the cross-case analysis and synthesis of the systematic research efforts which are progressively contributing to shedding light on the assemblage of sustainable smart city transitions.},

This research proposes a machine-learning-based method to model individual daily social activities from travel survey data. Using Guangzhou as an example, we extract 21 dimensional spatial and temporal attributes to construct the random forest (RF) method to identify and validate social activities at the individual level. The experiment result shows the recognition accuracy of our approach is 75\%. The effects of different factors on social activity participation are also investigated. The proposed approach can help us better understand human behaviors and daily activities, and also provide valuable insights for land use and traffic management planning and other applications.},

The inference of departure/arrival time, mode, and purpose of a trip, for example, rely on the stop/motion patterns represented by smartphone sensor-data. As users handle smartphones for various purposes and their preferences determine different device positions while traveling, accelerometer and gyroscope, for instance, often present ambiguities that prevent accurate stop detection. To mitigate the impact of these ambiguities, we combine spatial time-series, i.e. GPS, with spatial context information retrieved from Open Street Map, which we represent as multi-dimension tensors. This project explores simple representations, such as dummy variables, and novel multidimensional representations, which are bench-marked through the classification performance of specialized artificial neural network (ANN), as well as other machine learning (ML) baselines. Our main contribution stems from this novel multidimensional representation of time-series fusion with spatial context, combined with the corresponding specialized ANN classifier. The results show a stop detection score improvement on the baselines between 3\% and 6.5\%.},

Furthermore, we apply ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) coupled with post-hoc Tukey\&rsquo;s test to assess the statistical difference in sixteen recoded demographic/socioeconomic variables (from ACS 2014\&ndash;2018 estimates) among the identified time-series clusters. We find that demographic/socioeconomic variables can explain the disparity in home dwell time in response to the stay-at-home order, which potentially leads to disparate exposures to the risk from the COVID-19. The results further suggest that socially disadvantaged groups are less likely to follow the order to stay at home, pointing out the extensive gaps in the effectiveness of social distancing measures that exist between socially disadvantaged groups and others. Our study reveals that the long-standing inequity issue in the U.S. stands in the way of the effective implementation of social distancing measures.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This study reveals the human mobility from various sources and the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the disparities in mobility dynamics from lower-income and upper-income counties. We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four sources: 1) Apple mobility trend reports, 2) Google community mobility reports, 3) mobility data from Descartes Labs, and 4) Twitter mobility calculated via weighted distance. We further design a Responsive Index (RI) based on the time series of mobility change percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive correlations in the RI between either two data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearson r coefficients. Despite the similarity, however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. The positive correlation between RI and income at the county level is significant in all mobility datasets, suggesting that counties with higher income tend to react more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in RI between their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages can be found. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that cross-compares multi-source mobility datasets. The findings shed light on not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the mobility patterns in tandem with the economic disparity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The current COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns worldwide, leading to serious health, economic, and social challenges. The rapid spread of the virus at a global scale highlights the need for a more harmonized, less privacy-concerning, easily accessible approach to monitoring the human mobility that has proven to be associated with viral transmission. In this study, we analyzed over 580 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated information at the global, country, and U.S. state scale. Considering the multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness in certain geographic regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data are amenable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March 11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have obviously affected people{\textquoteright}s travel routines. The country scale comparisons reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation measures, proving that Twitter-based mobility implies the effectiveness of those measures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is distinct. However, the impacts vary substantially among states.},

	abstract = {Although mixed use is an emerging strategy that has been widely accepted in urban planning for promoting neighbourhood vibrancy, there is no consensus on how to quantitatively measure the mix and the effects of mixed use on neighbourhood vibrancy. Shannon entropy, the most commonly used diversity measurement in assessing mixed use, has been found to be inadequate in measuring the multifaceted, multidimensional characteristics of mixed use. And lack of data also makes it difficult to find the relationship between mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy. However, the recent availability of new sources including mobile phone data and Point of Interest (POI) data have made it possible to develop new indices of mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy to analyse their relationships. Taking advantage of these emerging new data sources, this study used the numbers of mobile phone users in a 24-hour period as a proxy of neighbourhood vibrancy and used POIs from a navigation database to develop a series of mixed-use indicators that can better reflect the multifaceted, multidimensional characteristics of mixed-use neighbourhoods. The Hill numbers, a unified form of diversity measurement used in ecological literature that includes richness, entropy, and the Simpson index, are used to measure the degrees of mixed use. Using such fine-grained data sets and the Hill numbers allowed us to obtain better insights into the relationship between mixed use and neighbourhood vibrancy. Four models varying in POI measurements that reflect different dimensions of mixed use were presented. The results showed that either POI density or entropy can explain approximately 1\% of neighbourhood vibrancy, while POI richness contributes significantly in improving neighbourhood vibrancy. The results also revealed that the entropy has limitations as a measure for representing mixed use and demonstrated the necessity of adopting a set of more appropriate measurements for mixed use. Increasing the number of POIs has limited power to improve neighbourhood vibrancy compared with encouraging the mixing of complementary POIs. These exploratory findings may be useful for adjusting mixed-use assessments and to help guide urban planning and neighbourhood design.},

	abstract = {Understanding residents' daily activity chains provides critical support for various applications in transportation, public health and many other related fields. Recently, mobile phone location datasets have been suggested for mining activity patterns because of their utility and large sample sizes. Although recently machine learning-based models seem to perform well in activity purpose inference using mobile phone location data, most of these models work as black boxes. To address these challenges, this study proposes a flexible white box method to mine human activity chains from large-scale mobile phone location data by integrating both the spatial and temporal features of daily activities with varying weights. We find that the frequency distribution of major activity chain patterns agrees well with the patterns derived based on a travel survey of Shenzhen and a state-of-the-art method. Moreover, a dataset covering over 16.5\% of the city population can yield a reasonable outcome of the major activity patterns. The contributions of this study not only lie in offering an effective approach to mining daily activity chains from mobile phone location data but also involve investigating the impact of different data conditions on the model performance, which make using big trajectory data more practical for domain experts.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for delineating urban functional areas based on building-level social media data. Our method assumes that social media activities in buildings of similar functions have similar spatiotemporal patterns. We subsequently apply a dynamic time warping (DTW) distance based k-medoids method to group buildings with similar social media activities into functional areas. The proposed method is applied in the Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, China. We carry out two clustering experiments with k=2 and k=8. In the experiment with k=2, buildings are separated into two groups based on density values. Buildings with higher density are situated mainly within the traditional city core and urban villages in the northern part of study area. The results for k=8 suggest that most buildings have mixed functions. In addition, heterogeneity can be discerned even in the clusters with similar urban functions. Concentric spatial structures are observed in urban villages that were previously deemed disordered. We also assess the diversity of urban functions at the community level and identify several potential {\textquoteleft}central places{\textquoteright} based on hot spot analysis. Our analysis provides an alternative way of characterizing intra-city urban spatial structure and could therefore inform future planning and policy evaluation.},

	abstract = {Location-aware big data from social media have been widely used to study functions of different zones in a city but not across a city as a whole. In this study, a novel framework is proposed to quantify city-level dynamic functions of 200 cities in China from a perspective of collective human activities. The random forest model was used to determine the temporal variations in the proportions of different urban functions by examining the relationship between Points-of-Interest (POIs) and Tencent Location Request (TLR) data. We then hierarchically clustered and analyzed the structures and distribution patterns of the dynamic urban functions of 200 Chinese cities at different temporal scales. In the end, we calculated an urban functional equilibrium index based on the urban functional proportion and then mapped spatial distribution patterns of the indexes across mainland China. Results show that on a daily scale when the cities were grouped into two clusters, they are either dominated by the work/education and commerce or residence functions. The cities in the former cluster are mainly the provincial capitals and located within major urban agglomerations. When the cities were grouped into four clusters, the clusters are dominated their commerce, work, residence, and balanced multiple functions, respectively. For each of the 200 cities, its urban functions change dynamically from the daybreak to the evening in terms of human activities. Besides, the equilibrium indexes show a power-law relationship with their rankings. Our research shows that city-level dynamic function can be quantified from the perspective of variations in human activities by using social media big data that otherwise could not be achieved in the conventional urban functions{\textquoteright} studies.},

With advances in data collection techniques and data analytic approaches, urban big data (UBD) is currently generated at an unprecedented scale in relation to volume, variety, and speed, producing new possibilities for applying UBD for TB research. A review of more than 50 scholarly articles confirms the remarkable and expanding role of UBD in TB research and its advantages over traditional survey data. Using this body of published work, a typology is developed of four key types of UBD{\textemdash}social media, GPS log, mobile phone/location-based service, and smart card{\textemdash}focusing on the features and applications of each type in the context of TB research. This paper discusses in significant detail the opportunities and challenges in the use of UBD from three perspectives: conceptual, methodological, and political. The paper concludes with recommendations for researchers to develop data science knowledge and programming skills for analysis of UBD, for public and private sector agencies to cooperate on the collection and sharing of UBD, and for legislators to enforce data security and confidentiality. UBD offers both researchers and practitioners opportunities to capture urban phenomena and deepen knowledge about the TB of individuals.},

Therefore, the association between service facilities and vibrancy is crucial for urban managers to understand and improve city construction. Moreover, the rapid development of information and communications technology (ICT) allows researchers to easily and quickly collect a large volume of real-time data generated by people in daily life. In this study, against the background of emerging multi-source big data, we utilized Tencent location data as a proxy for 24-h vibrancy and adopted point-of-interest (POI) data to represent service facilities. An analysis framework integrated with ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models is proposed to explore the spatiotemporal relationships between urban vibrancy and POI-based variables. Empirical results show that (1) spatiotemporal variations exist in the impact of service facilities on urban vibrancy across Guangzhou, China; and (2) GTWR models exhibit a higher degree of explanatory capacity on vibrancy than the OLS models. In addition, our results can assist urban planners to understand spatiotemporal patterns of urban vibrancy in a refined resolution, and to optimize the resource allocation and functional configuration of the city.},

Based on a dataset of multisource geographical big data, the understanding and analysis of urban vibrancy can be deepened with fine granularity. The working framework in this study focuses on the comprehensive perspective of urban morphology, which is decomposed into two dimensions (formality and functionality) and four elements (road, block, building, point of interest). The geographically and temporally weighted regression model was first applied to determine the spatiotemporal effect of the morphological metrics on vibrancy, and then, the geographical detector was employed from the perspective of spatially stratified heterogeneity to reveal the synergetic impacts. The following findings were revealed. (1) Dense street networks, small and medium-sized blocks, and the diversification and intensification of building and land use are beneficial to urban vibrancy. (2) Under the premise of adapting to local conditions, urban spaces combine multiple morphological metrics for the accomplishment of a full-region and all-time vibrancy. (3) The mixture of urban functions is worthy of attention for vibrancy growth because of its extraordinary synergy, not its capacity. Morphological metrics serve to foster and prolong urban vibrancy, adapt to urban sustainability, and contend against inefficient, disorderly urban sprawl. These findings provide significant implications for urban planners/designers and policymakers to optimize urban morphology, improve the vibrancy in large cities, and implement high-quality city planning.},

Meanwhile, polycentric urban development has been highlighted by academics and policymakers as a sustainable urban development regime, although its purported benefits need to be further investigated. Against this background, this paper empirically examines the relationship between polycentricity and the provision of urban amenities in 309 Chinese cities. After controlling for the size, population density, wage, and human capital, this paper finds that a higher degree of intra-urban polycentricity is associated with a larger number of urban amenities. Additionally, when all the covariates above are held, a higher degree of intra-urban polycentricity is associated with a greater diversity of urban amenities. Robust checks show that these findings are consistent with different polycentricity indices and diversity measures. Finally, possible explanations of the relationship between intra-urban polycentricity and urban amenities are provided from both the producer and consumer perspectives.},

Urban planners have been committed to promoting compact development through high-density and mixed land use. However, a problem brought by such compact urban form is the mismatch between physical spaces and socio-economic activities. To date, minimal research has been conducted using spatial statistics to study this issue at the local scales. Moreover, urban night-time vitality has been consistently ignored in existing studies. In the current work, urban land use intensity was analyzed on the basis of street block density and typology, and urban daytime and night-time vitality were measured using small catering business and night-time light data, respectively. The spatial relationships between urban land use intensity and urban vitality were investigated using a local indicator of spatial association (LISA), and five megacities in China were taken as a case study to examine whether variations exist between different cities. Results showed a significant positive spatial autocorrelation between urban land use intensity and urban vitality according to global statistics. Therefore, socio-economic activities are more likely to be abundant in densely developed urban areas. However, local spatial mismatches were found in the five megacities, indicating overcrowded or underutilized urban spaces in all the cities. These relationships were associated with different urban areas (urbanized before 1995 and during 1995{\textendash}2015), land use conditions (function and mixture) and time periods (day and night). The results of this work will provide a comprehensive understanding of compact city and sustainability.},

	abstract = {Polycentrism has gradually become a newly emergent dimension of global urbanization. Many countries worldwide have tailored plans suited to functional polycentricity, in light of the prevalent {\textquotedblleft}ghost cities{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}empty towns{\textquotedblright} as lessons from the morphologically polycentric development practices. However, the subject of defining and measuring functional polycentricity is still in an initial development phase, both in theory and in methodology. This paper first establishes a general theoretical framework for understanding functional polycentricity from the lens of interactive human mobility among spatial units. Then, a new approach is proposed to identify and measure urban functional polycentricity from a multiscale perspective and further applied to the case of Shanghai, China. More specifically, the pick-up and drop-off points from taxi GPS data are used to examine the linkages among different urban units across various scales (e.g., census tract, 3000-m grid, 5000-m grid, and community). Complex network modeling, together with the sensitivity analysis, is further employed to identify the centers according to the spatial importance of each unit. The results show that (1) the approach proposed can effectively identify functional centers within urban setting; (2) an obvious polycentric structure exists in Shanghai and is sensitive to scale effects; (3) the estimates are more accurate and precise with the shrink of analysis unit size from community level to census tract level; and (4) under the same spatial scale, the grid-based analysis produces a more elaborated polycentric pattern compared with the traditional administration-based analysis. Finally, scale-dependent differences between morphological and functional polycentricity are distinguished for providing implications for urban planning. Our study is believed to renew the knowledge of polycentricity conceptualization.},

Assessing the quality of each street is important for managing natural and public resources, organizing urban morphologies and improving city vitality. While current research focuses on particular street assessment indices, such as accessibility and connectivity, they ignore biases in street assessment caused by differences in urban functions. To address this issue, an adaptive approach to assessing street quality from the perspective of the variation in urban functions is proposed. First, an adaptive urban function detection model is established, with street-level element segmenting using PSPNet and semantic urban function extraction using LDA topic modelling. On this basis, an urban function-driven street quality assessment is proposed to adaptively evaluate multilevel urban streets. Taking Tianhe District in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, as the study area, experiments using street view images and points of interest (POIs) are applied to validate the proposed approach. The experiment results in a model for adaptive urban function detection with an overall accuracy of 64.3\%, showing that streets with different urban functions, including traffic, commercial, and residential functions, can be assessed. The experimental results can facilitate urban function organization and urban land-use planning.},

While existing studies mainly capture mixed land use, density, and accessibility properties of the physical environment, urban characteristics depicted by the city morphologies have seldom been addressed. To fill this gap, a novel framework is proposed in this paper to explore the relationship between landscape characteristics and urban vibrancy. First, research approaches for delineating multi-level urban landscape characteristics {\textendash} including places, land use, and single and multiple landscape elements {\textendash} using spatial metrics were analysed. Then, place-based reviews from social media data were applied as proxies to quantitatively measure urban vibrancy. Finally, regression analyses were proposed to assess the relationship between landscape characteristics and urban vibrancy. Satisfactory regression model performances were attained with adjusted R2 values of 0.65, 0.65, 0.66, and 0.67 at each landscape characteristic level. The results indicate that changes in urban vibrancy are variable and highly dependent on the proposed multi-level characteristics. These findings may provide guidance for city planning and urban landscape design.},

Recently, social media data have proven to be a rich source of information, providing a novel way to derive urban spatial structures and their impact on the quality of life. Yet, integration of this wisdom in urban planning and policymaking has not been comprehensively investigated in high-density cities such as Hong Kong as it relates to spatial configurations. This study aims to investigate spatial structures and analyze social media data to apprise urban planning with knowledge of human activities. This study also seeks to introduce an exploratory analysis to develop a greater understanding of the interaction between social activities and urban space. The results show that function layout defines urban spatial structure and determines human social activities.

	abstract = {The design and optimization of urban form has always been a hot topic in urban planning and development research. Besides, the creation of continuous vitality in urban areas is of critical importance in the development of urbanization. However, due to the lack of data, it is difficult to measure the effects of urban form on neighborhood vibrancy. Additionally, no uniform conclusion has been drawn regarding to what degree urban form can contribute to neighborhood vibrancy. Taking advantage of emerging new data sources, the depth and breadth of related research can now be improved. Therefore, this paper uses high-precision positioning social media check-in data to approximate the vibrancy of 658 neighborhoods, and uses a geographical information system (GIS) to quantitatively measure the urban form indicators in the central area of Chengdu City, China. A quantitative exploration and analysis of the relationships between neighborhood vibrancy and urban form is conducted. The results of three regression models considering different explanatory variables show that socio-economic factors account for approximately 23\% of neighborhood vibrancy. In addition, the correlation between the shape characteristics of a neighborhood and the vibrancy is weak. However, when the inner urban form indicators of neighborhoods are introduced into the regression model, the goodness of fit (R2) is nearly doubled. This finding indicates that strong associations exist between urban form and neighborhood vibrancy. Specifically, building density and functional diversity are positively correlated with neighborhood vibrancy. Unlike existing studies, this study finds that the road network within the neighborhood plays a positive role in the creation of neighborhood vibrancy. However, the impact of a road density indicator is not as powerful as the impacts of building density and functional diversity. This research can help urban designers to better design urban environments.},

The vibrancy of a neighborhood represents a synergy between the people, activities, and values in a place, which increases community vitality and spurs economic opportunity. It can be investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, there are technical challenges involved in accurately charting vibrancy. With the recent advances in communication technology and the prevalence of location-aware devices such as mobile phones, individual trajectories can be collected and analyzed on a large scale. In previous research, the weights of the vibrancies corresponding to different trajectories were not differentiated. In this study, an improved PageRank algorithm using a weighted bipartite graph is proposed to measure the vibrancy of an urban neighborhood from a different perspective, which highlights the differences between vibrancies arising from different types of citizens. This method connects the land much more closely with human activities and provides a new perspective on, and guidance for, urban resource allocation and urban planning.},

This paper employs new urban data and analytical methods and explores the relationship between urban morphology and urban vitality using regression models. Shenzhen, one of the largest and fastest growing cities in China, is selected as the case study. The regression analysis focuses on two morphological factors, density and typology, while controlling for the accessibility, functional mix, and size of individual blocks. The presence of small catering businesses is used as a proxy for urban vitality. The analysis suggests that both typology and density matter for urban vitality, with typology playing a more important role.

Optimizing urban landscapes can promote urban vitality and quality, which is the latest goal of modern urban sustainable development. However, compared with studies at macro-level in large areas (i.e. cities) or micro-level in small areas (i.e. buildings), the fine research on quantifying urban landscape characteristics in large areas are insufficient, though it has stronger linkages with reality and planning. This paper proposed a quantification analysis system for regional urban landscape studies with block as the study unit and built on three aspects, including city plan, pattern of building forms and urban land use. Spatial and contrastive analysis were adopted to portray urban landscape in 15 typical Chinese cities using geographical open data. Urban landscape in metropolises of China had clear spatial regularity with the distance away from the main center. Besides, most of urban landscape indicators had more than one center and the main center was matched with the area of highest land price and geometric center in most of metropolises, and the attraction of sub-centers still had significant gap with the main center. Meantime, different cities may indeed display distinctive spatial signatures due to their different development conditions, for example, the landscape features of Guangzhou and Suzhou did not have superiority compared with other cities at similar level. More importantly, quantitative study scope and dimension of fine urban landscape were expanded and a uniform and comparable standard for block-level urban landscape analysis in large area was established.},

Developing vibrant communities can help boost commercial activities, enhance public security, foster social interaction, and thus yield livable, sustainable, and viable environments. However, it is challenging to understand the underlying drivers of vibrant communities to make them traceable and predictable. Toward this goal, we study the problem of ranking vibrant communities using human mobility data and point-of-interests (POIs) data. We analyze large-scale urban and mobile data related to residential communities and find that in order to effectively identify vibrant communities, we should not just consider community {\textquotedblleft}contents{\textquotedblright} such as buildings, facilities, and transportation, but also take into account the spatial structure. The spatial structure of a community refers to how the geographical items (POIs, road networks, public transits, etc.) of a community are spatially arranged and interact with one another. Along this line, we first develop a geographical learning method to find proper representations of communities. In addition, we propose a novel geographic ensemble ranking strategy, which aggregates a variety of weak rankers to effectively spot vibrant communities. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with real-world residential community data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

By learning the community structures, we can better quantitatively represent urban communities and understand their evolutions in the development of cities. This can help us boost commercial activities, enhance public security, foster social interactions, and, ultimately, yield livable, sustainable, and viable environments. However, due to the complex nature of urban systems, it is traditionally challenging to learn the structures of urban communities. To address this problem, in this article, we propose a collective embedding framework to learn the community structure from multiple periodic spatial-temporal graphs of human mobility. Specifically, we first exploit a probabilistic propagation-based approach to create a set of mobility graphs from periodic human mobility records. In these mobility graphs, the static POIs are regarded as vertexes, the dynamic mobility connectivities between POI pairs are regarded as edges, and the edge weights periodically evolve over time. A collective deep auto-encoder method is then developed to collaboratively learn the embeddings of POIs from multiple spatial-temporal mobility graphs. In addition, we develop a Unsupervised Graph based Weighted Aggregation method to align and aggregate the POI embeddings into the representation of the community structures. We apply the proposed embedding framework to two applications (i.e., spotting vibrant communities and predicting housing price return rates) to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Extensive experimental results on real-world urban communities and human mobility data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed collective embedding framework.},

The models of complex networks require a large amount of empirical data. However, current works relied on traditional survey data and were unable to take full advantage of the capabilities offered by complex networks; thus, the possibility of quantifying urban mobility networks by considering individual travel patterns has not yet been addressed. This study presents a data-driven approach for characterizing urban mobility networks based on massive-scale mobile phone tracking data. Individual travel motifs are first extracted using a graph-based approach. The global urban mobility network (G-UMN) and the motif-dependent urban mobility subnetworks (MD-UMNs) are then constructed. Next, network properties, including statistical measures and scaling relations between the basic measures, are proposed for characterizing mobility networks. We have conducted experiments focusing on Shenzhen, China. The results demonstrated that (1) the individual travel motifs are structurally and spatially heterogeneous, (2) the G-UMN exhibits a evolutionary hierarchical structure, and (3) the MD-UMNs show many behavioral differences in their spatial and topological properties, reflecting the impacts of the heterogeneity of the individual travel motifs. These results bridge the gap between complex network properties and urban mobility patterns and provide crucial implications and policies for data-informed urban planning.},

	abstract = {As the essence of urban spatiotemporal interaction systems, hubs and centers empower cities to enhance socioeconomic prosperity and sustainability. However, a city manifests a time-evolving spatial interaction network with latent temporal interactions and irregular spatial partitions. This phenomenon is termed the spatiotemporal inconsistency problem. The aggregate, single-layer network model is defective for capturing the importance of locations in such time-evolving spatial interaction systems. This article therefore proposes a novel multilayer network model based on the nature of inherent spatial and temporal dependencies of urban interactions. First, the spatial agglomeration and the temporal correlation are explicitly modeled in multilayer networks for alleviating the spatiotemporal inconsistency problem. Secondly, generalized centrality metrics from a single-layered static network to the multi-layered dynamic network are acquired in order to discover grouped hub locations over time. Lastly, the capability of the proposed method is evaluated by an empirical analysis of the taxi mobility networks of Beijing, China, from 2012 to 2017. The empirical analysis indicates that the proposed method enables the identification of typical hub locations clustered in space and stable over time. This ability is essential to understand the centrality of locations informed by noisy and inconsistent data in their spatial and temporal dimensions.},

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a wealth of studies on characterizing human mobility patterns using movement datasets. Such efforts have highlighted a few salient dimensions of individual travel behavior relevant to urban planning and policy analysis. Despite the fruitful research outcomes, most of the findings are drawn upon urban residents. The behavioral characteristics of other population groups, such as tourists, remain underexplored. In this study, we introduce an analytical framework to gain insights into tourist mobility patterns. By analyzing mobile phone trajectories of international travelers to three different cities in South Korea, we introduce nine mobility indicators to capture different facets of tourist travel behavior (e.g., duration of stay in a city, spatial extent of activities, location visited and trips conducted, and mobility diversity), and examine their statistical properties across cities. An eigendecomposition approach is then introduced to better understand the interdependency of these mobility indicators and inherent variations among individual travelers. Based on the eigendecomposition results, we further employ a dimension reduction technique to describe the key characteristics of each traveler. Since the mobile phone dataset captures the nationality of tourists, we use such information to quantify the behavioral heterogeneity of travelers across countries and regions. Finally, we select a few traveler groups with distinctive mobility patterns in each city and examine the spatial patterns of their activities. Substantial differences are observed among traveler groups in their spatial preferences. The implications for location recommendation and deployment of tourism services (e.g., transportation) are discussed. We hope the study brings a synergy between classic human mobility analysis and the emerging field of tourism big data. The framework can be applied or extended to compatible datasets to understand travel behavior of tourists, residents, and special population groups in cities.},

Furthermore, this study identifies factors that affect the variations of workplace segregation. The study shows that rural migrants who work in manufacturing industries and live in suburban areas suffer from higher workplace segregation from other social groups compared with those who work in service jobs and reside in the central-city areas, indicating that migrant enclaves in central-city areas play a significant role in housing rural migrants. It provides them with considerable access to service jobs and, thus, alleviates workplace segregation. Our results show that the use of big data can effectively capture the dynamics of population composition in activity places and provide a useful perspective for a deeper understanding of socio-spatial segregation.},

	abstract = {A mega city region comprises a cluster of highly networked urban settlements anchored by one or more large cities. Substantial studies have been conducted in the 21st century to theorise the development of mega city regions from two perspectives: one focuses on the rationale/challenges of planning and governance while the other focuses on the economic forces that generate the mega city regions. In China, the outstanding position of mega city regions in China{\textquoteright}s economic development has been accentuated in both academic research and recent policies. Recent studies have unpacked the political dynamics of mega city regions in China and identified challenges for planning and governance. The present study approaches this issue through another theoretical lens and deciphers the economic process underneath the recent upsurge of Chinese mega city regions. By unfolding the economic transition since the late 1970s to trace the footprints of mega city region development, the paper contributes a discourse of how different waves of economic transition {\textendash} that is, rural industrialisation, land-centred development and urban tertiarisation {\textendash} have been steering individual cities towards super mega city regions. The paper also identifies the distinctive challenges confronting the future development of China{\textquoteright}s mega city regions, including jurisdictional fragmentation, socio-spatial inequality and environmental externalities, which were created because of the strong bottom-up initiatives in land development during rural industrialisation. New policies and planning are required in response to these challenges as well as to the emerging new industries in the new wave of economic transition (i.e. from labour-intensive industries to the development of high-tech industries).},

	abstract = {Polycentric metropolitan regions are a high-level urbanization form characterized with dynamic layout, fuzzy boundary and various human activity performances. Owing to the complexity of polycentricity, it can be difficult to understand their spatial structure characteristics merely based on conventional survey data and method. This poses a challenge for authorities wishing to make effective urban land use and transport policies. Fortunately, the presence and availability of big data provides an opportunity for scholars to explore the complex metropolitan spatial structures, but there are still some research limitations in terms of data use and processing, unit scale, and method. To address these limitations, we proposed a three-step method to apply the carpooling big data in metropolitan analysis including: first, locating the metropolitan sub-centers; second, delimiting the metropolitan sphere; third, measuring the performance of polycentric structure. The developed method was tested in Beijing Metropolitan Region and the results show that the polycentric metropolitan region represents a hierarchical regional center system: one primary center interacting with seven surrounding secondary centers. These metropolitan centers have a strong attraction, which results in the continuous expansion beyond the administrative boundary to radiate more adjacent jurisdictions. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of human activity performance and role for each regional center is remarkable. It is necessary to consider the specific role of each sub-center when making metropolitan transport and land use policies. Compared with previous studies, the proposed method has the advantages of being more reliable, accurate and comprehensive in characterizing the polycentric spatial structure. The application of carpooling big data and the proposed method would provide a novel perspective for research on the other metropolitan regions.},

	abstract = {Fine-scale population distribution data at the building level play an essential role in numerous fields, for example urban planning and disaster prevention. The rapid technological development of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) in recent decades has benefited numerous population distribution mapping studies. However, most of these studies focused on global population and environmental changes; few considered fine-scale population mapping at the local scale, largely because of a lack of reliable data and models. As geospatial big data booms, Internet-collected volunteered geographic information (VGI) can now be used to solve this problem. This article establishes a novel framework to map urban population distributions at the building scale by integrating multisource geospatial big data, which is essential for the fine-scale mapping of population distributions. First, Baidu points-of-interest (POIs) and real-time Tencent user densities (RTUD) are analyzed by using a random forest algorithm to down-scale the street-level population distribution to the grid level. Then, we design an effective iterative building-population gravity model to map population distributions at the building level. Meanwhile, we introduce a densely inhabited index (DII), generated by the proposed gravity model, which can be used to estimate the degree of residential crowding. According to a comparison with official community-level census data and the results of previous population mapping methods, our method exhibits the best accuracy (Pearson R = .8615, RMSE = 663.3250, p {\textless} .0001). The produced fine-scale population map can offer a more thorough understanding of inner city population distributions, which can thus help policy makers optimize the allocation of resources.},

An associated outcome of the upsampling process is the solution of two major problems existing in the NTL image, pixel saturation, and blooming effects. Compared with the original stable light image, digital number (DN) values of the upsampled stable light image have larger correlation coefficients with gridded population (0.47 versus 0.09) and DN values of the new generation NTL image product (0.56 versus 0.52), i.e., the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite day/night band image composite. In addition, total personal incomes of states are disaggregated to each pixel in proportion to the DN value of the pixel in the NTL images and then aggregate by counties. Personal incomes distributed by the upsampled NTL image are closer to the official demographic data than those distributed by the original stable light image. All of these results explore the potential of geotagged tweets to improve the quality of NTL images for more accurately estimating or mapping socioeconomic factors.},

In this study we aim to use location-based social media big data to challenge the primacy of NTL imagery on estimating socioeconomic factors. Geo-tagged tweets posted in the contiguous United States in 2013 were retrieved to produce a tweet image with the same spatial resolution of the NTL imagery (i.e., 0.00833{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 0.00833{\textdegree}). Sum tweet (the total number of tweets) and sum light (summed DN value of the NTL image) of each state or county were obtained from the tweets and the NTL images, respectively, to estimate three important socioeconomic factors: personal income, electric power consumption, and fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions. Results show that sum tweet is a better measure of personal income and electric power consumption while carbon dioxide emissions can be more accurately estimated by sum light. We further exploited that African-Americans adults are more likely than White seniors to post geotagged tweets in the US, yet did not find any significant correlations between proportions of the subpopulations and the estimation accuracy of the socioeconomic factors. Existence of saturated pixels and blooming effects and failure to remove gas flaring reduce quality of NTL imagery in estimating socioeconomic factors, however, such problems are nonexistent in the tweet images. This study reveals that the number of geo-tagged tweets has great potential to be deemed as a substitute of brightness of NTL to assess socioeconomic factors over large geographic areas.},

A global night-time image product was registered to a dataset of 2000 known city locations with known populations. A relationship between areal extent and city population discovered by Tobler and Nordbeck is identified on a nation by nation basis to estimate the population of the 22 920 urban clusters that exist in the night-time satellite image. The relationship between city population and city areal extent was derived from 1597 city point locations with known population that landed in a 'lit' area of the image. Due to conurbation, these 1597 cities resulted in only 1383 points of analysis for performing regression. When several cities fell into one 'lit' area their populations were summed. The results of this analysis allow for an estimate of the urban population of every nation of the world. By using the known percent of population in urban areas for every nation a total national population was also estimated. The sum of these estimates is a total estimate of the global human population, which in this case was 6.3 billion. This is fairly close to the generally accepted contemporaneous (1997) estimate of the global population which stood at approximately 5.9 billion.},

	abstract = {Since the late 1990s, remotely sensed night-time lights (NTL) satellite imagery has been shown to correlate with socioeconomic parameters including urbanization, economic activity, and population. More recent research demonstrates that multitemporal NTL data can serve as a reliable proxy for change over time in these variables whether they are increasing or decreasing. Time series analysis of NTL data is especially valuable for detecting, estimating, and monitoring socioeconomic dynamics in countries and subnational regions where reliable official statistics may be lacking. Until 2012, multitemporal NTL imagery came primarily from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program - Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS), for which digital imagery is available from 1992 to 2013. In October 2011, the launch of NASA/NOAA's Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite, whose Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor has a Day/Night Band (DNB) specifically designed for capturing radiance from the Earth at night, marked the start of a new era in NTL data collection and applications. In light of these advances, this paper reviews progress in using multitemporal DMSP-OLS and VIIRS imagery to analyze urbanization, economic, and population dynamics across a range of geographic scales. An overview of data corrections and processing for comparison of multitemporal NTL imagery is provided, followed by a meta-analysis and integrative synthesis of these studies. Figures are included that visualize the capabilities of DMSP-OLS and VIIRS to capture socioeconomic change in the post-Soviet Russian Far East and war-torn Syria, respectively. Finally, future directions for NTL research are suggested, particularly in the areas of determining the fundamental causes of observed light and in leveraging VIIRS' superior sensitivity and spatial and radiometric resolution.},

Since it was launched in October 2011, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Satellite has become a new satellite used to monitor nighttime light. This study performed the first evaluation on the NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery in modeling economy, analyzing 31 provincial regions and 393 county regions in China. For each region, the total nighttime light (TNL) and gross regional product (GRP) around the year of 2010 were derived, and a linear regression model was applied on the data. Through the regression, the TNL from NPP-VIIRS were found to exhibit R2 values of 0.8699 and 0.8544 with the provincial GRP and county GRP, respectively, which are significantly stronger than the relationship between the TNL from DMSP-OLS (F16 and F18 satellites) and GRP. Using the regression models, the GRP was predicted from the TNL for each region, and we found that the NPP-VIIRS data is more predictable for the GRP than those of the DMSP-OLS data. This study demonstrates that the recently released NPP-VIIRS nighttime light imagery has a stronger capacity in modeling regional economy than those of the DMSP-OLS data. These findings provide a foundation to model the global and regional economy with the recently availability of the NPP-VIIRS data, especially in the regions where economic census data is difficult to access.},

Considerable efforts have been devoted to build the connections between nightlight signals and demographic and economic variables at local to global scales in order to obtain observationally based estimates for human activity. Recently, the first cloud-free composite of global nighttime light data derived from the Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor yields an increasingly clearer view of the earth surface on nights. The responses to socioeconomic activity and the potential utility of VIIRS nighttime light data, however, still remain less well understood. In this study, we examined the quantitative relationships between VIIRS nightlight-derived indices and socioeconomic variables at fine and local scales. Our results suggest that the total night radiance has significant positive associations with two airport performance indicators {\textendash} passenger traffic and aircraft movement. In addition, there is a strong correlation with four urbanization variables {\textendash} human population, gross domestic product, electric power consumption and paved road area. Our findings suggest that VIIRS nightlight data could be more indicative of socioeconomic dynamics and may provide insights into the potential applications for studying human settlement and urbanization processes based on anthropogenic nocturnal lighting.},

	abstract = {Urbanization process involving increased population size, spatially extended land cover and intensified economic activity plays a substantial role in anthropogenic environment changes. Remotely sensed nighttime lights datasets derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) provide a consistent measure for characterizing trends in urban sprawl over time (Sutton, 2003). The utility of DMSP/OLS imagery for monitoring dynamics in human settlement and economic activity at regional to global scales has been widely verified in previous studies through statistical correlations between nighttime light brightness and demographic and economic variables (Elvidge et al., 2001, Ghosh et al., 2010). The quantitative relationship between long-term nighttime light signals and urbanization variables, required for extensive application of DMSP/OLS data for estimating and projecting the trajectory of urban development, however, are not well addressed for individual cities at a local scale. We here present analysis results concerning quantitative responses of stable nighttime lights derived from time series of DMSP/OLS imagery to changes in urbanization variables during 1994{\textendash}2009 for more than 200 prefectural-level cities and municipalities in China. To identify the best-fitting model for nighttime lights-based measurement of urbanization processes with different development patterns, we comparatively use three regression models: linear, power-law and exponential functions to quantify the long-term relationships between nighttime weighted light area and four urbanization variables: population, gross domestic product (GDP), built-up area and electric power consumption. Our results suggest that nighttime light brightness could be an explanatory indicator for estimating urbanization dynamics at the city level. Various quantitative relationships between urban nighttime lights and urbanization variables may indicate diverse responses of DMSP/OLS nighttime light signals to anthropogenic dynamics in urbanization process in terms of demographic and economic variables. At the city level, growth in weighted lit area may take either a linear, concave (exponential) or convex (power law) form responsive to expanding human population and economic activities during urbanization. Therefore, in practice, quantitative models for using DMSP/OLS data to estimate urbanization dynamics should vary with different patterns of urban development, particularly for cities experiencing rapid urban growth at a local scale.},

The majority of studies to date have used the coarse spatial resolution datasets of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). In this study, we hypothesize that night-time lights can serve as an indicator for demographic and socio-economic properties of built-up areas at a local scale. We used night-time light images acquired by the American DMSP (2003, 2.7km), Argentinean SAC-C (2007, 300m) and photographs taken by astronauts from the International Space Station (ISS; 2003, 60m). We compared the night-time lights of built-up areas based on their geographical location (Israel and the West Bank) and their population (Jewish and Arab). Israeli localities were better lit than West Bank localities, corresponding to the difference in the gross domestic product of the two entities. No difference was found in the night-time lights brightness of Jewish and Arab localities within Israel. However, night-time lights of built-up areas with a Jewish population within Israel and the West Bank were positively correlated with population density and roads density. In contrast, built-up areas with an Arab population had weaker correlations. Differences in the urban structure of Jewish and Arab built-up areas, as well as economic and geopolitical differences between Israel and the West Bank led to the observed differences in night-time lights patterns. Demographic and infrastructure data were able to explain 60\% of the spatial variation of the ISS night-time lights, compared with only 28\% of the spatial variation of the DMSP night-time lights dataset. The results of this study demonstrate potential uses of night-time lights databases of high spatial resolution, and emphasize the need for a dedicated night-time lights observing satellite.},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban development at regional and global scales is increasingly important for urban planning, policy decision making and resource use and conservation. Continuous satellite derived observations of anthropogenic lighting signal at night provide consistent and efficient proxy measures of demographic and socioeconomic dynamics in the urbanization process. Previous studies have demonstrated significant positive correlations between the nocturnal light brightness, mainly derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS), and population and economic variables. Quantitative measurements of artificial lighting emissions at night therefore can be indicative of the overall degree of socioeconomic development at regional to country levels. The spatio-temporal characteristics of anthropogenic night-time lighting, potentially connected to the dynamic patterns of spatially expanding human settlement and economic activities during the urban expansion process, however, has received less attention largely because of diversity of both socioeconomic activity and urban forms. Based upon the quadratic relationship between the pixel-level night-time light radiance and corresponding brightness gradient (i.e. the rate of maximum local change) at the local scale, we here proposed a spatially explicit approach for partitioning DMSP/OLS night-time light images into five types of night-time lighting areas for individual cities: low, medium-low, medium, medium-high and high, generally associated with urban sub-areas experienced distinctly different forms and human activity. At the country scale, our findings suggest that significant rises are commonly found in these five types of night-time lighting areas with different growth rates across 271 China's cities from 1992 to 2012. At the urban scale, however, five types of night-time lighting areas show various trends for individual cities in relation to the urban size and development levels. The marked increase in high night-time lighting area is highly prevalent in most of China's cities with rapid urbanization over the past 21years while significantly decreased low and medium-low night-time lighting areas are most likely to occur in large and extra-large cities. Moreover, the transition between different types of night-time lighting areas could further portray the spatio-temporal characteristics of urban development. Analyzing results indicate that the spatial expansions of gradually intensified night-time light brightness correspond geographically with the rural{\textendash}urban gradients following a stepwise transition of night-time light brightness during the urban expansion.},

Based on quantitative analyses and urban simulations, this study proposes a large-scene urbanization quantitative spatial analysis framework via nighttime light and random forests-based cellular automata and explores changes in the urbanization of the Hu Line pattern in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative. This study analyzes the past urbanization status on both sides of the Hu Line and predicts the future distribution and proportion of urban land on both sides of the Hu Line in the context of the Belt and Road Initiative. The new impacts that the Belt and Road Initiative may bring to the domestic regions are concretized and coupled with cellular automata. The results show that the proportion of urban land on both sides of the Hu Line was 93.94:6.06 in 2005 and that it will reach 93.07:6.93 in 2035. A significant difference in urbanization is revealed between the two sides; however, the difference decreases annually. Overall, the distribution of urbanization in China will retain the southeast-northwest pattern of the Hu Line in 2015{\textendash}2035.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a methodology to assess the evidence of human presence and human activities in the Brazilian Amazonia region using DMSP/OLS night-time satellite sensor imagery. It consists on exploring the potential of the sensor data for regional studies analysing the correlation between DMSP night-time light foci and population, and the correlation between DMSP night-time light foci and electrical power consumption. In the mosaic of DMSP/OLS night-time light imagery from September 1999, 248 towns were detected from a total of 749 munic{\i}?pios in Amazonia. It was found that the night-time light foci were related to human presence in the region, including urban settlements, mining, industries, and civil construction, observed in ancillary Landsat TM and JERS imagery data. The analysis considering only the state of Par{\'a} revealed a linear relation (R2=0.79) between urban population from the 1996 census data and DMSP night-time light foci. Similarly, electrical power consumption for 1999 was linearly correlated with DMSP night-time light foci. Thus the DMSP/OLS imagery can be used as an indicator of human presence in the analysis of spatial{\textendash}temporal patterns in the Amazonia region. These results are very useful considering the continental dimension of Amazonia, the absence of demographic information between the official population census (every 10 years), and the dynamics and complexity of human activities in the region. Therefore DMSP night-time light foci are a valuable data source for global studies, modelling, and planning activities when the human dimension must be considered throughout Amazonia.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of night light emissions in the visible band offers a unique opportunity to directly observe human activity from space. This has allowed a host of applications including mapping urban areas, estimating population and GDP, monitoring disasters and conflicts. More recently, remotely sensed night lights data have found use in understanding the environmental impacts of light emissions (light pollution), including their impacts on human health. In this review, we outline the historical development of night-time optical sensors up to the current state of the art sensors, highlight various applications of night light data, discuss the special challenges associated with remote sensing of night lights with a focus on the limitations of current sensors, and provide an outlook for the future of remote sensing of night lights. While the paper mainly focuses on space borne remote sensing, ground based sensing of night-time brightness for studies on astronomical and ecological light pollution, as well as for calibration and validation of space borne data, are also discussed. Although the development of night light sensors lags behind day-time sensors, we demonstrate that the field is in a stage of rapid development. The worldwide transition to LED lights poses a particular challenge for remote sensing of night lights, and strongly highlights the need for a new generation of space borne night lights instruments. This work shows that future sensors are needed to monitor temporal changes during the night (for example from a geostationary platform or constellation of satellites), and to better understand the angular patterns of light emission (roughly analogous to the BRDF in daylight sensing). Perhaps most importantly, we make the case that higher spatial resolution and multispectral sensors covering the range from blue to NIR are needed to more effectively identify lighting technologies, map urban functions, and monitor energy use.},

	abstract = {The modern planning and management of urban spaces is an essential topic for smart cities and depends on up-to-date and reliable information on land use and the functional roles of the places that integrate urban areas. In the last few years, driven by the increased availability of geo-referenced data from social media, embedded sensors, and remote sensing images, various techniques have become popular for land use analysis. In this paper, we first highlight and discuss the different data types and methods usually adopted in this context, as well as their purposes. Then, based on a systematic state-of-the-art study, we focused on exploring the potential of points of interest (POIs) for land use classification, as one of the most common categories of crowdsourced data. We developed an application to automatically collect POIs for the study area, creating a dataset that was used to generate a large number of features. We used a ranking technique to select, among them, the most suitable features for classifying land use. As ground truth data, we used CORINE Land Cover (CLC), which is a solid and reliable dataset available for the whole European territory. It uses an artificial neural network (ANN) in different scenarios and our results reveal values of more than 90\% for the accuracy and F-score in one experiment performed. Our analysis suggests that POI data have promising potential to characterize geographic spaces. The work described here aims to provide an alternative to the current methodologies for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which are usually time-consuming and depend on expensive data types.},

	abstract = {Flood inundation probability is critical for situation awareness, flood mitigation, emergency response, and postevent damage assessment. Current flood inundation mapping approaches can be categorized into real-time (RT) and nearRT (NRT) processes based on the timing of data acquisition. However, the intrinsic limitations of each category largely hamper their applications for flood mapping. Taking the 2015 South Carolina flood in downtown Columbia as a case study, this paper proposes a flood inundation reconstruction model by enhancing the NRT normalized difference water index (NDWI) derived from remote sensing imagery with the RT data including stream gauge readings and social media (tweets). Splitting into three modules: water height module, global enhancement module, and local enhancement module, the proposed model first incorporates the gauge readings and the NDWI image to reconstruct a macroscale flood probability layer, which is then locally enhanced using the verified flood-related tweets. The final output of the model matches well with the U.S. Geological Survey inundation map and its surveyed high-water marks. Results suggest that by enhancing NRT imagery with RT data sources, the proposed flood inundation probability reconstruction model renders a more robust, spatially enhanced flood probability index for emergency responders to quickly identify areas in need of urgent attention.},

Such systems are based on both dedicated sensor nodes, and ubiquitous but not dedicated devices such as smart phones and vehicles{\textquoteright} sensors. When we design sensor network monitoring systems for smart cities, we have two essential problems: node deployment and sensing management. These design problems are challenging, due to large urban areas to monitor, constrained locations for deployments, and heterogeneous type of sensing devices. There is a vast body of literature from different disciplines that have addressed these challenges. However, we do not have yet a comprehensive understanding and sound design guidelines. This paper addresses such a research gap and provides an overview of the theoretical problems we face, and what possible approaches we may use to solve these problems. Specifically, this paper focuses on the problems on both the deployment of the devices (which is the system design/configuration part) and the sensing management of the devices (which is the system running part). We also discuss how to choose the existing algorithms in different type of monitoring applications in smart cities, such as structural health monitoring, water pipeline networks, traffic monitoring. We finally discuss future research opportunities and open challenges for smart city monitoring.},

	abstract = {The development of mobile internet, smartphones, and location-based services has enabled ridesourcing, which pools vehicles and drivers to provide ondemand travel services. As an alternative transportation option, ridesourcing has significant impacts on urban travel. However, the unique mobility pattern of ridesourcing and its impact on vehicle electrification have not been well studied. To this gap, this paper presents a comparative, big-data driven framework to characterize the ridesourcing mobility pattern, and evaluate the acceptance potential of electric vehicles for ridesourcing in comparison with other types of vehicle usage. Multitemporal resolution ridesourcing trips are extracted from raw GPS trajectories. The patterns of three urban travel (household, ridesourcing, and taxis) are extracted from GPS trajectories in Bejing, and compared. The electrification potentials of these travel under different charging levels are then evaluated. The results demonstrate that mobility patterns of household, ridesourcing, and taxi drivers are similar when a single trip is considered, but differ significantly when total vehicle travel is considered. We show that potential acceptance of electric vehicles decreases significantly from household to ridesourcing and taxi vehicle use. These findings provide useful insights into of the role vehicle electrification can play in sustainability of urban personal transportation across a range of drivers.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has spread throughout the world, posing a major threat to human beings. The stay-home quarantine is an effective way to reduce physical contacts and the associated COVID-19 infection risk, which also requires the support of efficient living materials (i.e., meats, vegetables, grain, and oil, etc.) delivery. Notably, the presence of infected individuals increases the COVID-19 transmission risk during delivery. The deliveryman may become the medium through which the virus spreads among residential neighborhoods. For example, the news that pizza delivery man and delivery drivers have come out as a positive case for the COVID-19 has been reported. However, traditional delivery route optimization methods don{\textquoteright}t take into account the virus infection risk. Here, we propose a novel living material delivery route approach considering the possible COVID-19 transmission during the delivery. A complex network-based virus transmission model is developed to simulate the possible COVID-19 infection between residents and the deliverymen. A bi-objective model considering the COVID-19 infection risk and the total route length is proposed and solved by the hybrid meta-heuristics integrating the adaptive large neighborhood search and simulated annealing. The experiment was conducted in Wuhan, China to assess the performance of the proposed approach. The results in Wuhan demonstrate that 935 vehicles will totally travel 56,424.55 km to deliver necessary living materials to 3,514 neighborhoods, with total risk $\delta$ 404.25, which significantly better than traditional methods. The presented approach can facilitate the well response to the COVID-19 in the transportation sector.},

	abstract = {Predicting the passenger flow of metro networks is of great importance for traffic management and public safety. However, such predictions are very challenging, as passenger flow is affected by complex spatial dependencies (nearby and distant) and temporal dependencies (recent and periodic). In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning-based approach, named STGCNNmetro (spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural networks for metro), to collectively predict two types of passenger flow volumes{\textemdash}inflow and outflow{\textemdash}in each metro station of a city. Specifically, instead of representing metro stations by grids and employing conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture spatiotemporal dependencies, STGCNNmetro transforms the city metro network to a graph and makes predictions using graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs). First, we apply stereogram graph convolution operations to seamlessly capture the irregular spatiotemporal dependencies along the metro network. Second, a deep structure composed of GCNNs is constructed to capture the distant spatiotemporal dependencies at the citywide level. Finally, we integrate three temporal patterns (recent, daily, and weekly) and fuse the spatiotemporal dependencies captured from these patterns to form the final prediction values. The STGCNNmetro model is an end-to-end framework which can accept raw passenger flow-volume data, automatically capture the effective features of the citywide metro network, and output predictions. We test this model by predicting the short-term passenger flow volume in the citywide metro network of Shanghai, China. Experiments show that the STGCNNmetro model outperforms seven well-known baseline models (LSVR, PCA-kNN, NMF-kNN, Bayesian, MLR, MCNN, and LSTM). We additionally explore the sensitivity of the model to its parameters and discuss the distribution of prediction errors.},

This study presents an approach to generating a 100 m population grid in the Contiguous United States (CONUS) by disaggregating the US cen- sus records using 125 million of building footprints released by Microsoft in 2018. Land-use data from the OpenStreetMap (OSM), a crowdsourcing platform, was applied to trim original footprints by removing the non-residential buildings. After trimming, several metrics of building measurements such as building size and build- ing count in a census tract were used as weighting scenarios, with which a dasymetric model was applied to disaggregate the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year estimates (2013{\textendash}2017) into a 100 m population grid product. The results confirm that the OSM trimming process removes non-residential buildings and thus provides a better representation of population distribution within complicated urban fabrics. The building size in the census tract is found in the optimal weighting scenario. The product is 15Gb in size containing 800 million populated grids and is currently hosted by ESRI (http://arcg.is/19S4qK) for open access. With the acceler- ated acquisition of high-resolution spatial data, the product could be easily updated for spatial and temporal continuity.},

	abstract = {Time series forecasting and spatiotemporal kriging are the two most important tasks in spatiotemporal data analysis. Recent research on graph neural networks has made substantial progress in time series forecasting, while little attention is paid to the kriging problem{\textemdash}recovering signals for unsampled locations/sensors. Most existing scalable kriging methods (e.g., matrix/tensor completion) are transductive, and thus full retraining is required when we have a new sensor to interpolate. In this paper, we develop an Inductive Graph Neural Network Kriging (IGNNK) model to recover data for unsampled sensors on a network/graph structure. To generalize the effect of distance and reachability, we generate random subgraphs as samples and reconstruct the corresponding adjacency matrix for each sample. By reconstructing all signals on each sample subgraph, IGNNK can effectively learn the spatial message passing mechanism. Empirical results on several real-world spatiotemporal datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. In addition, we also find that the learned model can be successfully transferred to the same type of kriging tasks on an unseen dataset. Our results show that: 1) GNN is an efficient and effective tool for spatial kriging; 2) inductive GNNs can be trained using dynamic adjacency matrices; and 3) a trained model can be transferred to new graph structures.},

This study provides a comparative assessment of the population exposed to flood hazards for the entire Conterminous United States and answers the following four fundamental questions: 1) how many people are exposed? 2) who are they? 3) how are they distributed? 4) how do the estimations from other floodplains differ from the esti- mations from FEMA floodplain? In light of the limitations of previous flood exposure studies in the U.S, this study uses the recently released Microsoft building footprint dataset to capture the heterogeneity of population dis- tribution at the micro-level. The population at block group level from ACS 5-year estimates (2013{\textendash}2017) is further disaggregated to residential buildings, identified via NLUD 2010 and OpenStreetMap Land Use polygons. A comparative study is then conducted to investigate the 100-year flood exposure from FEMA and from the other three publicly available 100-year floodplains. Although the exposure analysis shows varying spatial patterns for selected floodplains, it indicates that a large number of exposed residents are found in regions where FEMA floodplain product is unavailable, presumably responsible for the uncaptured losses reported from other studies. In addition, the inequitably high flood risk experienced by the poor revealed at the national level underscores the significance of flood vulnerability studies to emphasize the need for this vulnerable group.},

	abstract = {Timely accurate traffic forecast is crucial for urban traffic control and guidance. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow, traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in traffic domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units, we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer parameters. Experiments show that our model STGCN effectively captures comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations through modeling multi-scale traffic networks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world traffic datasets.},

	abstract = {Understanding quantitative relationships between urban elements is crucial for a wide range of applications. The observation at the macroscopic level demonstrates that the aggregated urban quantities (e.g., gross domestic product) scale systematically with population sizes across cities, also known as urban scaling laws. However, at the mesoscopic level, we lack an understanding of whether the simple scaling relationship holds within cities, which is a fundamental question regarding the spatial origin of scaling in urban systems. Here, by analyzing four extensive~datasets covering millions of mobile phone users and urban facilities, we investigate the scaling phenomena within cities. We find that the mesoscopic infrastructure volume and socioeconomic activity scale sub- and super-linearly with the active population, respectively. For a same scaling phenomenon, however, the exponents vary in cities of similar population sizes. To explain these empirical observations, we propose a conceptual framework by considering the heterogeneous distributions of population and facilities, and the spatial interactions between them. Analytical and numerical results suggest that, despite the large number of complexities that influence urban activities, the simple interaction rules can effectively explain the observed regularity and heterogeneity in scaling behaviors within cities.},

They allow for a new paradigm of city planning and for an understanding of urban resilience and economics. The emergence of these power-law relations is still unclear. Improving our understanding of their origin will help us to better apply them in practical applications and further research their properties. In this work, we derive the basic exponents for spatially distributed variables from fundamental fractal geometric relations in cities. Sub-linear scaling arises as the ratio of the fractal dimension of the road network and of the distribution of the population embedded in three dimensions. Super-linear scaling emerges from human interactions that are constrained by the geometry of a city. We demonstrate the validity of the framework with data from 4750 European cities. We make several testable predictions, including the relation of average height of cities and population size, and the existence of a critical density above which growth changes from horizontal densification to three-dimensional growth.},

	abstract = {Cellular Automata (CA) are widely used to model the dynamics within complex land use and land cover (LULC) systems. Past CA model research has focused on improving the technical modeling procedures, and only a few studies have sought to improve our understanding of the nonlinear relationships that underlie LULC change. Many CA models lack the ability to simulate the detailed patch evolution of multiple land use types. This study introduces a patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model that integrates a land expansion analysis strategy and a CA model based on multi-type random patch seeds. These were used to understand the drivers of land expansion and to investigate the landscape dynamics in Wuhan, China. The proposed model achieved a higher simulation accuracy and more similar landscape pattern metrics to the true landscape than other CA models tested. The land expansion analysis strategy also uncovered some underlying transition rules, such as that grassland is most likely to be found where it is not strongly impacted by human activities, and that deciduous forest areas tend to grow adjacent to arterial roads. We also projected the structure of land use under different optimizing scenarios for 2035 by combining the proposed model with multi-objective programming. The results indicate that the proposed model can help policymakers to manage future land use dynamics and so to realize more sustainable land use patterns for future development.

	abstract = {The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in 1961 and is now one of the most influential book in city planning. In it, Jane Jacobs proposed four conditions that promote life in a city. However, these conditions have not been empirically tested until recently. This is mainly because it is hard to collect data about "city life". The city of Seoul recently collected pedestrian activity through surveys at an unprecedented scale, with an effort spanning more than a decade, allowing researchers to conduct the first study successfully testing Jacobs's conditions. In this paper, we identify a valuable alternative to the lengthy and costly collection of activity survey data: mobile phone data. We extract human activity from such data, collect land use and socio-demographic information from the Italian Census and Open Street Map, and test the four conditions in six Italian cities. Although these cities are very different from the places for which Jacobs's conditions were spelled out (i.e., great American cities) and from the places in which they were recently tested (i.e., the Asian city of Seoul), we find those conditions to be indeed associated with urban life in Italy as well. Our methodology promises to have a great impact on urban studies, not least because, if replicated, it will make it possible to test Jacobs's theories at scale.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10036},
	abstract = {Mobile device location data (MDLD) contains abundant travel behavior information to support travel demand analysis. Compared to traditional travel surveys, MDLD has larger spatiotemporal coverage of population and its mobility. However, ground truth information such as trip origins and destinations, travel modes, and trip purposes are not included by default. Such important attributes must be imputed to maximize the usefulness of the data. This paper tends to study the capability of MDLD on estimating travel mode share at aggregated levels. A data-driven framework is proposed to extract travel behavior information from the MDLD. The proposed framework first identifies trip ends with a modified Spatiotemporal Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-DBSCAN) algorithm. Then three types of features are extracted for each trip to impute travel modes using machine learning models. A labeled MDLD dataset with ground truth information is used to train the proposed models, resulting in 95\% accuracy in identifying trip ends and 93\% accuracy in imputing five travel modes (drive, rail, bus, bike and walk) with a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed framework is then applied to two large-scale MDLD datasets, covering the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area and the United States, respectively. The estimated trip distance, trip time, trip rate distribution, and travel mode share are compared against travel surveys at different geographies. The results suggest that the proposed framework can be readily applied in different states and metropolitan regions with low cost in order to study multimodal travel demand, understand mobility trends, and support decision making.},

Until now, however, based on low time resolution measurements, previous works have ignored to study human mobility under various time scales due to sparse and irregular calls, particularly in the era of mobile Internet. In this paper, we introduced Mobile Flow Records, flow-level data access records of online activity of smartphone users, to explore human mobility. Mobile Flow Records collect high-resolution information of large populations. By exploiting this kind of data, we show the models and statistics of human mobility at a large-scale (3,542,235 individuals) and finer-granularity (7.5min). Next, we investigated statistical variations and biases of mobility models caused by different time scales (from 7.5min to 32h), and found that the time scale does influence the mobility model, which indicates a deep coupling of human mobility and time. We further show that mobility behaviors like transportation modes contribute to the diversity of human mobility, by exploring several novel and refined features (e.g., motion speed, duration, and trajectory distance). Particularly, we point out that 2-hour sampling adopted in previous works is insufficient to study detailed motion behaviors. Our work not only offers a macroscopic and microscopic view of spatial-temporal human mobility, but also applies previously unavailable features, both of which are beneficial to the studies on phenomena driven by human mobility.},

In this regard, the value added of network analysis is that it allows inspecting {\textendash} in an intuitive fashion {\textendash} commuting-induced topology and accessibility.

	abstract = {At present, the vast majority of building blocks, techniques, and architectures for deep learning are based on real-valued operations and representations. However, recent work on recurrent neural networks and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests that complex numbers could have a richer representational capacity and could also facilitate noise-robust memory retrieval mechanisms. Despite their attractive properties and potential for opening up entirely new neural architectures, complex-valued deep neural networks have been marginalized due to the absence of the building blocks required to design such models. In this work, we provide the key atomic components for complex-valued deep neural networks and apply them to convolutional feed-forward networks and convolutional LSTMs. More precisely, we rely on complex convolutions and present algorithms for complex batch-normalization, complex weight initialization strategies for complex-valued neural nets and we use them in experiments with end-to-end training schemes. We demonstrate that such complex-valued models are competitive with their real-valued counterparts. We test deep complex models on several computer vision tasks, on music transcription using the MusicNet dataset and on Speech Spectrum Prediction using the TIMIT dataset. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on these audio-related tasks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09060},
	abstract = {The growing popularity of e-scooters and their rapid expansion across urban streets has attracted widespread attention. A major policy question is whether e-scooters substitute existing mobility options or fill the service gaps left by them. This study addresses this question by analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of e-scooter service availability and use in Washington DC, focusing on their spatial relationships with public transit and bikesharing. Results from an analysis of three open big datasets suggest that e-scooters have both competing and complementary effects on transit and bikesharing services. The supply of e-scooters significantly overlaps with the service areas of transit and bikesharing, and we classify a majority of e-scooter trips as substitutes to transit and bikesharing uses. A travel-time-based analysis further reveals that when choosing e-scooters over transit, travelers pay a price premium and save some travel time. The price premium is greater during the COVID-19 pandemic but the associated travel-time savings are smaller. This implies that public health considerations rather than time-cost tradeoffs are the main driver for many to choose e-scooters over transit during COVID. In addition, we find that e-scooters complement bikesharing and transit by providing services to underserved neighborhoods. A sizeable proportion (about 10 percent) of e-scooter trips are taken to connect with the rail services. Future research may combine the big-data-based analysis presented here with traditional methods to further shed light on the interactions between e-scooter services, bikesharing, and public transit.},

Fortunately, the increased data available about urban systems opens the possibility of constructing a quantitative {\textquoteleft}science of cities{\textquoteright}, with the aim of identifying and modelling essential phenomena. Statistical physics plays a major role in this effort by bringing tools and concepts able to bridge theory and empirical results. This Perspective illustrates this point by focusing on fundamental objects in cities: the distribution of the urban population; segregation phenomena and spin-like models; the polycentric transition of the activity organization; energy considerations about mobility and models inspired by gravity and radiation concepts; CO2 emitted by transport; and finally, scaling that describes how various socio-economical and infrastructures evolve when cities grow.},

	abstract = {We analyse two large-scale intra-city urban networks and traffic flows therein measured by GPS traces of taxis in San Francisco and Shanghai. Our results coincide with previous findings that, based purely on topological means, it is often insufficient to characterise traffic flow. Traditional shortest-path betweenness analysis, where shortest paths are calculated from each pairs of nodes, carries an unrealistic implicit assumption that each node or junction in the urban network generates and attracts an equal amount of traffic. We also argue that weighting edges based only on euclidean distance is inadequate, as primary roads are commonly favoured over secondary roads due to the perceived and actual travel time required. We show that betweenness traffic analysis can be improved by a simple extended framework which incorporates both the notions of node weights and fastest-path betweenness. We demonstrate that the framework is superior to traditional methods based solely on simple topological perspectives.},

Exploring the nature of the spatio-temporal patterns of mobile phone activity could thus be a crucial step towards understanding the full spectrum of human activities. Using 10 months of mobile phone records from Greater London resolved in both space and time, we investigate the regularity of human telecommunication activity on urban scales. We evaluate several options for decomposing activity timelines into typical and residual patterns, accounting for the strong periodic and seasonal components. We carry out our analysis on various spatial scales, showing that regularity increases as we look at aggregated activity in larger spatial units with more activity in them. We examine the statistical properties of the residuals and show that it can be explained by noise and specific outliers. Also, we look at sources of deviations from the general trends, which we find to be explainable based on knowledge of the city structure and places of attractions. We show examples how some of the outliers can be related to external factors such as specific social events.},

This urban human mobility data contains rich knowledge about locations and can help in addressing many urban challenges such as traffic congestion or air pollution problems. In this article, we survey recent literature on urban human mobility from a data mining view: from the data collection and cleaning, to the mobility models and the applications. First, we summarize recent public urban human mobility data sets and how to clean and preprocess such data. Second, we describe recent urban human mobility models and predictors, e.g., the deep learning predictor, for predicting urban human mobility. Third, we describe how to evaluate the models and predictors. We conclude by considering how applications can utilize the mobility models and predictive tools for addressing city challenges.},

New operational and pricing strategies will then evolve, providing service in a more efficient way and utilizing a dynamic landscape of urban transportation.

	abstract = {Characterizing the spatio-temporal evolution of networks is a central topic in many disciplines. While network expansion has been studied thoroughly, less is known about how empirical networks behave when shrinking. For transportation networks, this is especially relevant on account of their connection with the socio-economical substrate, and we focus here on the evolution of the French railway network from its birth in 1840 to 2000, in relation to the country{\textquoteright}s demographic dynamics. The network evolved in parallel with technology (e.g. faster trains) and under strong constraints, such as preserving a good population coverage and balancing cost and efficiency. We show that the shrinking phase that started in 1930 decreased the total length of the network while preserving efficiency and population coverage: efficiency and robustness remained remarkably constant while the total length of the network shrank by 50\% between 1930 and 2000, and the total travel time and time-diameter decreased by more than 75\% during the same period. Moreover, shrinking the network did not affect the overall accessibility with an average travel time that decreases steadily since its formation. This evolution leads naturally to an increase in transportation multimodality (such as a massive use of cars) and shows the importance of considering together transportation modes acting at different spatial scales. More generally, our results suggest that shrinking is not necessarily associated with a decay in performance and functions but can be beneficial in terms of design goals and can be part of the natural evolution of an adaptive network.},

	abstract = {The authors combine measures of urban form and public transit supply for 114 urbanized areas with the 1990 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey to address two questions: (1) How do measures of urban form, including city shape, road density, the spatial distribution of population, and jobs-housing balance affect the annual miles driven and commute mode choices of U.S. households? (2) How does the supply of public transportation (annual route miles supplied and availability of transit stops) affect miles driven and commute mode choice? The authors find that jobs-housing balance, population centrality, and rail miles supplied significantly reduce the probability of driving to work in cities with some rail transit. Population centrality and jobs-housing balance have a significant impact on annual household vehicle miles traveled (VMT), as do city shape, road density, and (in rail cities) annual rail route miles supplied. The elasticity of VMT with respect to each variable is small, on the order of 0.10-0.20 in absolute value. However, changing several measures of form simultaneously can reduce annual VMT significantly. Moving the sample households from a city with the characteristics of Atlanta to a city with the characteristics of Boston reduces annual VMT by 25 percent.},

The probability of driving to work is lower the higher are population centrality and rail miles supplied and the lower is road density. Population centrality, jobs-housing balance, city shape, and road density have a significant effect on annual household VMTs. Although individual elasticities are small absolute values (<=0.10), moving sample households from a city with the characteristics of Atlanta to a city with the characteristics of Boston reduces annual VMTs by 25\%.},

While these modes are typically separated for economic reasons, in the future with shared Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) providing cheap and efficient transportation services, such distinctions will blur. Consequently, optimization based on real-time data will allow exploiting parallels in demand in a dynamic way, such as the proposed approach in the current work. New operational and pricing strategies will then need to be considered, along with regulatory tools to limit congestion, encourage sharing and provide services in a more sustainable way by utilizing a dynamic landscape of urban transportation. In the current work, we evaluate existing parallels between individual bus and taxi trips in two Asian cities and show how exploiting these synergies could form the basis of achieving some of the above goals in the future.},

	abstract = {Many of the real systems such as social, technological, biological and informational systems can be described as complex networks. In this study we are interested in two types of movement networks that occur in the United Kingdom, which are internal migration and commuting. United Kingdom 2001 Census data has been used in order to analyze movement networks through complex network tools at different spatial scales. Nodes represent locations in movement networks rather than individuals and edges store the total number of movements from one location to another. At larger scale, we observed high correlations between in- and out-degree of each location; however at smaller level degree correlations were not that informative so we analyzed the network motif structures, which are small patterns of interconnection that occur more frequently than one would expect from random networks. We observed different motif structures for internal migration and commuting networks. The results for reciprocity, which characterises the simplest non-trivial motif, are also presented in this study. A major motivation for studying movement networks is to understand the influence of network characteristics on epidemic spreading. The epidemic threshold for a network is closely related to the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix, which we calculate.},

	abstract = {The dense social contact networks and high mobility in congested urban areas facilitate the rapid transmission of infectious diseases. Typical mechanistic epidemiological models are either based on uniform mixing with ad-hoc contact processes or need real-time or archived population mobility data to simulate the social networks. However, the rapid and global transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has led to unprecedented lockdowns at global and regional scales, leaving the archived datasets to limited use. While it is often hypothesized that population density is a significant driver in disease propagation, the disparate disease trajectories and infection rates exhibited by the different cities with comparable densities require a high-resolution description of the disease and its drivers. In this study, we explore the impact of creation of containment zones on travel patterns within the city. Further, we use a dynamical network-based infectious disease model to understand the key drivers of disease spread at sub-kilometer scales demonstrated in the city of Ahmedabad, India, which has been classified as a SARS-CoV-2 hotspot. We find that in addition to the contact network and population density, road connectivity patterns and ease of transit are strongly correlated with the rate of transmission of the disease. Given the limited access to real-time traffic data during lockdowns, we generate road connectivity networks using open-source imageries and travel patterns from open-source surveys and government reports. Within the proposed framework, we then analyze the relative merits of social distancing, enforced lockdowns, and enhanced testing and quarantining mitigating the disease spread. Our results suggest that the declaration of micro-containment zones within the city with high road network density combined with enhanced testing can help in containing the outbreaks until clinical interventions become available.},

	abstract = {Urban perception is a hot topic in current urban study and plays a positive role in urban planning and design. At present, there are two methods to calculate urban perception. 1) Using a model to learn image features directly automatically; 2) Coupling machine learning and feature extraction based on expert knowledge (e.g. object proportion) method. With two typical streets in Wuhan as the study area, video data were recorded and used as the model input. In this study, two representative methods are selected: 1) End to end convolution neural network (CNN-based model); 2) Based on full convolution neural network and random forest (FCN + RF-based model). By comparing the accuracy of two models, we analyze the adaptability of the model in different urban scenes. We also analyze the relationship between CNN-based model and urban function based on POI data and OSM data, and verify its interpretability. The results show that the CNN-based model is more accurate than FCN + RF-based model. Because the CNN-based model considers the topological characteristics of the ground objects, its perception results have a stronger nonlinear correlation with urban functions. In addition, we also find that the CNN-based model is more suitable for scenes with weak spatial heterogeneity (such as small and medium-sized urban environments), while the FCN + RF-based model is applicable to scenes with strong spatial heterogeneity (such as the downtown areas of China{\textquoteright}s megacities). The results of this study can be used as a reference to provide decision support for urban perception model selection in urban planning.},

Second, we bridge UGC and professional-generated content (PGC), in order to take advantage of both sides. The third application links multi-sourced UGC to uncover urban spatial structures and human dynamics. We suggest that UGC data contain rich information in diverse aspects. In addition, analysis of sentiment from geotagged texts and photos, along with the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods, is discussed to help understand the linkage between human emotions and surrounding environments.

Economic complexity research applies new empirical methods and considers both social and environmental sustainability, but seldom scrutinizes theory and policy. Industrial policy research focuses on green growth policies but tends to omit social sustainability issues and advanced empirical methods. Research on economic diversification in poor regions provides insights on the livelihood diversification of farmers, but is disconnected from the economic complexity and industrial policy research. This review helps to summarize the main contributions and shows pathways for potential mutual learning between these communities for the sake of sustainable development.},

Social distancing and stay-at-home orders leave businesses and cities wondering what economic activity will look like in the future. Given a likely reduction in face-to-face interactions, it is important to better understand how social interactivity influences economic outcomes. Here we measure the effect of social interactions in the workforce on patent production and economic efficiency. We decompose U.S. occupations into individual work activities, determine which of those activities are associated with face-to-face interactions, and reaggregate the labor force of each U.S. metropolitan statistical area (MSA) into a metric of social interactiveness. We then calculate each MSA{\textquoteright}s density of social work activities and find that this measure is more highly correlated with an MSA{\textquoteright}s per capita patent production than simple population density. This suggests that density of face-to-face interactions is the important driver of a city{\textquoteright}s rate of invention. We close by exploring analogies between the development of cities and the development of stars, suggesting ways these analogies may help frame future research on cities.},

It is innovative in three respects: First, in its structure {\textendash} the proposed model is built as a superposition of two types of models; the first is an Agent Based Urban Simulation Model (ABUSM) that simulates the movement and interaction of agents in the urban space and the second is a network model that simulates the resultant urban network as it evolves. Secondly, it is innovative in the specific behavior of its agents {\textendash} urban agents in our model act locally (as usual) but in order to do so, they perceive the city globally, i.e. they {\textquotedblleft}think globally and act locally{\textquotedblright}. In our model, the local activities and interactions of agents give rise to the global urban structure and network that in turn affects the agents{\textquoteright} cognition, behavior, movement, and action in the city and so on in circular causality. The third aspect of innovation is connected with the specific urban phenomena it simulates {\textendash} the vast majority of USM simulate the growth and expansion of urban systems but few simulate the reverse process of re-urbanization and gentrification; our model simultaneously captures the two processes and the interplay between them.Cities are complex systems by their nature. They have originally emerged, and are still developing, out of the interactions between many agents that are located and move in space and time. These interactions result in many links that create complex networks which form the city. In the last two decades CA and AB USM have provided the main approaches to studying the dynamics of cities as complex self-organizing systems. In the last few years, models based on the new science of networks have been introduced as well. This research direction is new in the conjunction it suggests between traditional network analysis (e.g. graph theory) and complexity theory. We introduce a new dynamic model for city development, based on the evolution and structure of urban networks.},

	abstract = {Rapid urbanization has given rise to serious urban problems. It is crucial to understand the urbanization process to accurately and quickly identify boundary changes in urban built-up areas and implement planning schemes and adjustments in scientific and effective ways. This study proposes a new method to automate and refine the extraction of urban built-up areas by using Landsat and nighttime light (NTL) imagery. The urban agglomeration of Dongting Lake Ecological Economic Zone (UADLEEZ) Landsat data are mapped to NTL data using resampling, superpixel segmentation, and assigning the blank part with the Euclidean distance method. We then compared our findings with those produced via traditional threshold extraction methods. In total, 33 built-up areas of UADLEEZ boundary maps were produced between 1992 and 2018. Thus, we reached the following conclusions: (1) the urban built-up areas obtained via our proposed method are finer than those obtained via other threshold extraction methods; (2) we applied the extraction method to UADLEEZ, and analyzed the expansion of the urban agglomeration based on expansion scale, gravity center offset, and landscape pattern index, the analysis of expansion process is consistent with the actual situation; (3) the proposed method can be used to draw long-term dynamic maps of urban extents in units of years, and the results can be used to update the existing products. This study can serve as a reference for future urban planning, and provide both adjustment programs for relevant departments, and an objective basis for governmental decision-making.},

Our current understandings of risk perceptions regarding COVID-19 do not disentangle the three dimensions of risk perceptions (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and negative emotion) over a long enough timeframe to cover different pandemic phases. The impact of social determinants of health factors on COVID-19-related risk perceptions over time is also not clear. To address these two knowledge gaps, we extracted tweets regarding COVID-19-related risk perceptions and developed index indicators for three dimensions of risk perceptions based on over 297 million geotagged tweets posted by over 3.5 million Twitter users from January to October 2020 in the United States. We also examined correlations between index indicator scores and county-level social determinants of health factors. The three domains of risk perceptions demonstrate different trajectories. Perceived severity kept climbing throughout the whole study period. Perceived susceptibility and negative emotion declined and remained stable at a lower level after peaking on March 11 (WHO named COVID-19 a global pandemic). Attention on risk perceptions was not exactly in accordance with epidemic trends of COVID-19 (cases, deaths). Users from socioeconomically vulnerable counties showed lower attention on perceived severity and susceptibility of COVID-19 than those from wealthier counties. Examination of trends in tweets regarding the multiple domains of risk perceptions throughout stages of the COVID-19 pandemic can help policy makers frame in-time, tailored, and appropriate responses to prevent viral spread and encourage preventive behavior uptake in United States.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The city has proved to be the most successful form of human agglomeration and provides wide employment opportunities for its dwellers. As advances in robotics and artificial intelligence revive concerns about the impact of automation on jobs, a question looms: how will automation affect employment in cities? Here, we provide a comparative picture of the impact of automation across US urban areas. Small cities will undertake greater adjustments, such as worker displacement and job content substitutions. We demonstrate that large cities exhibit increased occupational and skill specialization due to increased abundance of managerial and technical professions. These occupations are not easily automatable, and, thus, reduce the potential impact of automation in large cities. Our results pass several robustness checks including potential errors in the estimation of occupational automation and subsampling of occupations. Our study provides the first empirical law connecting two societal forces: urban agglomeration and automation's impact on employment.},

	abstract = {Learning explicit and implicit patterns in human trajectories plays an important role in many Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) applications, such as trajectory classification (e.g., walking, driving, etc.), trajectory-user linking, friend recommendation, etc. A particular problem that has attracted much attention recently - and is the focus of our work - is the Trajectory-based Social Circle Inference (TSCI), aiming at inferring user social circles (mainly social friendship) based on motion trajectories and without any explicit social networked information. Existing approaches addressing TSCI lack satisfactory results due to the challenges related to data sparsity, accessibility and model efficiency. Motivated by the recent success of machine learning in trajectory mining, in this paper we formulate TSCI as a novel multi-label classification problem and develop a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based framework called DeepTSCI to use human mobility patterns for inferring corresponding social circles. We propose three methods to learn the latent representations of trajectories, based on: (1) bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); (2) Autoencoder; and (3) Variational autoencoder. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed methods perform well and achieve significant improvement in terms of macro-R, macro-F1 and accuracy when compared to baselines.},

	abstract = {Understanding how citizens interact with transportation system is a key to solving a variety of urban issues in general and traffic congestion in particular. Recently, scholars have put efforts on the pertinent work ranging from developing traffic predictors to understanding human mobility and activity patterns. Multiple types of data have been used, of which crowdsourced data (e.g. social media data) plays an essential role. Due to the limitation of traffic information extraction from social media data raised in the existing work, this paper aims to develop an approach which allows us to explore the potential influence of human activities on daily traffic congestions through linking human activities derived from geotagged tweets to the daily traffic conditions. The result of a case study of Toronto, Canada exhibits that entertainment related activities are more likely to appear during evening peak hours, while it seems that morning rush hours are less sensitive to human activities. In addition, it is learned that the activities involved in international events tend to have a long-term impact on urban traffic. This work provides a new tool for urban planners and policy makers to deal with complex urban issues effectively using low-cost social media data and sheds light on the research on analyzing urban traffic and urban dynamics based on crowdsourced data.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to propose and test an adaptive reinforcement learning model that can learn the patterns of human mobility in a normal context and simulate the mobility during perturbations caused by crises, such as flooding, wildfire, and hurricanes. Understanding and predicting human mobility patterns, such as destination and trajectory selection, can inform emerging congestion and road closures raised by disruptions in emergencies. Data related to human movement trajectories are scarce, especially in the context of emergencies, which places a limitation on applications of existing urban mobility models learned from empirical data. Models with the capability of learning the mobility patterns from data generated in normal situations and which can adapt to emergency situations are needed to inform emergency response and urban resilience assessments. To address this gap, this study creates and tests an adaptive reinforcement learning model that can predict the destinations of movements, estimate the trajectory for each origin and destination pair, and examine the impact of perturbations on humans' decisions related to destinations and movement trajectories. The application of the proposed model is shown in the context of Houston and the flooding scenario caused by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. The results show that the model can achieve more than 76{\textbackslash}\% precision and recall. The results also show that the model could predict traffic patterns and congestion resulting from to urban flooding. The outcomes of the analysis demonstrate the capabilities of the model for analyzing urban mobility during crises, which can inform the public and decision-makers about the response strategies and resilience planning to reduce the impacts of crises on urban mobility.},

However, very few works have leveraged public bicycle-sharing data, which provides a useful feature in depicting people\&rsquo;s short-trip transportation within a city, in the studies of urban functions and structure. Because of its convenience, bicycle usage tends to be close to point-of-interest (POI) features, the combination of which will no doubt enhance the understanding of the trip purpose for characterizing different functional zones. In our study, we propose a data-driven approach that uses station-based public bicycle rental records together with POI data in Hangzhou, China to identify urban functional zones. Topic modelling, unsupervised clustering, and visual analytics are employed to delineate the function matrix, aggregate functional zones, and present mixed land uses. Our result shows that business areas, industrial areas, and residential areas can be well detected, which validates the effectiveness of data generated from this new transportation mode. The word cloud of function labels reveals the mixed land use of different types of urban functions and improves the understanding of city structures.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In a metropolis, people movements design intricate patterns that change on very short temporal scales. Population mobility obviously is not random, but driven by the land uses of the city. Such an urban ecosystem can interestingly be explored by integrating the spatial analysis of land uses (through ecological indicators commonly used to characterize natural environments) with the temporal analysis of human mobility (reconstructed from anonymized mobile phone data). Considering the city of Milan (Italy) as a case study, here we aimed to identify the complex relations occurring between the land-use composition of its neighborhoods and the spatio-temporal patterns of occupation made by citizens. We generated two spatially explicit networks, one static and the other temporal, based on the analysis of land uses and mobile phone data, respectively. The comparison between the results of community detection performed on both networks revealed that neighborhoods that are similar in terms of land-use composition are not necessarily characterized by analogous temporal fluctuations of human activities. In particular, the historical concentric urban structure of Milan is still under play. Our big data driven approach to characterize urban diversity provides outcomes that could be important (i) to better understand how and when urban spaces are actually used, and (ii) to allow policy makers improving strategic development plans that account for the needs of metropolis-like permanently changing cities.},

Its classical definition as the number of secondary cases generated by a typical infected individual in a fully susceptible population finds a clear analytical expression in homogeneous and stratified mixing models. Along with the generation time (the interval between primary and secondary cases), the reproduction number allows for the characterization of the dynamics of an epidemic. A clear-cut theoretical picture, however, is hardly found in real data. Here, we infer from highly detailed sociodemographic data two multiplex contact networks representative of a subset of the Italian and Dutch populations. We then simulate an infection transmission process on these networks accounting for the natural history of influenza and calibrated on empirical epidemiological data. We explicitly measure the reproduction number and generation time, recording all individual-level transmission events. We find that the classical concept of the basic reproduction number is untenable in realistic populations, and it does not provide any conceptual understanding of the epidemic evolution. This departure from the classical theoretical picture is not due to behavioral changes and other exogenous epidemiological determinants. Rather, it can be simply explained by the (clustered) contact structure of the population. Finally, we provide evidence that methodologies aimed at estimating the instantaneous reproduction number can operationally be used to characterize the correct epidemic dynamics from incidence data.},

	abstract = {Whereas there has been an extended discussion concerning city population distribution, little has been said about that of administrative divisions. In this work, we investigate the population distribution of second-level administrative units of 150 countries and territories and propose the discrete generalized beta distribution (DGBD) rank-size function to describe the data. After testing the balance between the goodness of fit and number of parameters of this function compared with a power law, which is the most common model for city population, the DGBD is a good statistical model for 96\% of our datasets and preferred over a power law in almost every case. Moreover, the DGBD is preferred over a power law for fitting country population data, which can be seen as the zeroth-level administrative unit. We present a computational toy model to simulate the formation of administrative divisions in one dimension and give numerical evidence that the DGBD arises from a particular case of this model. This model, along with the fitting of the DGBD, proves adequate in reproducing and describing local unit evolution and its effect on the population distribution.},

	abstract = {Passively-generated data, such as GPS data and cellular data, bring tremendous opportunities for human mobility analysis and transportation applications. Since their primary purposes are often non-transportation related, the passively-generated data need to be processed to extract trips. Most existing trip extraction methods rely on data that are generated via a single positioning technology such as GPS or triangulation through cellular towers (thereby called single-sourced data), and methods to extract trips from data generated via multiple positioning technologies (or, multisourced data) are absent. And yet, multi-sourced data are now increasingly common. Generated using multiple technologies (e.g., GPS, cellular network- and WiFi-based), multi-sourced data contain high variances in their temporal and spatial properties. In this study, we propose a {\textquotedblleft}Divide, Conquer and Integrate{\textquotedblright} (DCI) framework to extract trips from multi-sourced data. We evaluate the proposed framework by applying it to an app-based data, which is multisourced and has high variances in both location accuracy and observation interval (i.e. time interval between two consecutive observations). The effectiveness of the framework is illustrated by consistent mobility patterns obtained from the app-based data and an externally collected household travel survey data for the same region and the same period.},

	abstract = {During the last years, the new science of cities has been established as a fertile quantitative approach to systematically understand the urban phenomena. One of its main pillars is the proposition that urban systems display universal scaling behavior regarding socioeconomic, infrastructural and individual basic services variables. This paper discusses the extension of the universality proposition by testing it against a broad range of urban metrics in a developing country urban system. We present an exploration of the scaling exponents for over 60 variables for the Brazilian urban system. Estimating those exponents is challenging from the technical point of view because the Brazilian municipalities{\textquoteright} definition follows local political criteria and does not regard characteristics of the landscape, density, and basic utilities. As Brazilian municipalities can deviate significantly from urban settlements, urban-like municipalities were selected based on a systematic density cut-off procedure and the scaling exponents were estimated for this new subset of municipalities. To validate our findings we compared the results for overlaying variables with other studies based on alternative methods. It was found that the analyzed socioeconomic variables follow a superlinear scaling relationship with the population size, and most of the infrastructure and individual basic services variables follow expected sublinear and linear scaling, respectively. However, some infrastructural and individual basic services variables deviated from their expected regimes, challenging the universality hypothesis of urban scaling. We propose that these deviations are a product of top-down decisions/policies. Our analysis spreads over a time-range of 10 years, what is not enough to draw conclusive observations, nevertheless we found hints that the scaling exponent of these variables are evolving towards the expected scaling regime, indicating that the deviations might be temporally constrained and that the urban systems might eventually reach the expected scaling regime.},

	doi = {10.3390/su10124566},
	abstract = {The relationship between polycentric urban form and urban commuting has been widely debated in Western academic circles. However, qualitative and quantitative studies have not reached a unified conclusion. The evolution of urban form in China is remarkably different from that of developed Western countries. Many Chinese cities have begun using polycentric structures as their future development strategies. This study quantitatively measures whether polycentric urban form can improve commuting efficiency in China by using traditional statistics and emerging geographic big data. We use the polycentric index (PI) as the dependent variable and the congestion delay index (CDI) and mean traffic speed (MTS) as the main independent variables. Control variables include urban morphological space compactness (CT), number of private cars per thousand people (PC), number of buses per thousand (PB), urban road area per capita (PUA) and urban population density (PD). Regression models are employed to detect the relationships among the variables. The main research conclusions are as follows: (1) A high degree of PI results in low CDI and fast MTS; (2) a compact spatial form increases the impact of polycentricity on commuting efficiency; (3) maturity road infrastructure is an important measure to promote urban commuting under a polycentric urban form; and (4) the order of effect magnitude of polycentricity on MTS is PD {\textgreater} PC {\textgreater} CT {\textgreater} PUA {\textgreater} PB; on CDI, PD {\textgreater} PC {\textgreater} PB {\textgreater} CT {\textgreater} PUA. The results can be used in examining whether the current polycentric urban pattern planning in China{\textquoteright}s cities can effectively improve commuting efficiency. They also provide a reference for the healthy development of China{\textquoteright}s urban space and policy formulation of subsequent urban planning.},

To identify the effects of land-use characteristics, socio-demographics, individual trip characteristics, and personal attitudes on the travel-activity based spatial behavior of various population groups in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, a household-based travel diary pilot survey (for two weekdays) was conducted for 50 randomly selected households in the winter of 2017. The study focused on two separate subareas: one taken from Dhaka North City Corporation, and another taken from Dhaka South City Corporation. Two methods{\textemdash}shortest-path network and road network buffer{\textemdash}were used for calculating activity space in a geographic information system (GIS). The daily activity areas for individual respondents ranged from 0.37 to 6.18 square miles. Land-use mix was found to be a significant predictor of activity space size for the residents. Larger activity space was recorded for the residents of one subarea over another due to less land-use diversity. The pilot data showed some specific socio-economic and travel differences across the two study subareas (car ownership, income, modal share, distance traveled, trip duration).},

In such situations one has to use quantum mechanics for studying physical systems of such extremely small dimensions. However, it is less readily recognized that even before reaching such extremely small dimensions leading to the breakdown of Newtonian mechanics there are many special aspects one needs to take care of for successful analysis and design of small systems. The counterintuitive features arise not due to breakdown of Newtonian mechanics but due to the changes in the order of predominance of physical phenomena caused by drastic reduction in size from the scales we are familiar with in our daily experience. In simple language this is called scaling effect and the laws which govern such effects are called scaling laws. While dealing with microsystems our normal engineering intuition fails and it needs to be replaced by special {\textquotedblleft}microintuition{\textquotedblright} for developing microsystems which is becoming a very important engineering activity with the turn of the century.

	abstract = {Given the ongoing {\textquotedblleft}mobility turn{\textquotedblright} in social science research, a more comprehensive understanding of segregation is needed. Activity-space-based segregation studies have aroused renewed interests in geography and urban planning research. Most of the existing studies utilized the differences in spatial characteristics of people's actual activity space to identify the segregation among social groups. However, few studies have examined activity-space-based segregation in terms of individuals' potential activity space and the temporal variations in their segregation experiences. This paper aims to help fill these two research gaps by implementing an empirical study in Beijing. We examine the activity-space-based segregation of the residents of different types of housing in a Beijing suburb in terms of both actual activity space and potential activity space. We further investigate the temporal variations of the residents' segregation experiences during a week. A 7-day individual GPS tracking dataset, combined with the activity diary data and the socioeconomic attributes data of 422 participants is used for the study. The major finding is that residents of different types of housing in Beijing do experience activityspace-based segregation, while the characteristics of segregation vary with respect to actual activity space and potential activity space. Also, participants' segregation experiences varies between different days of the week. This paper offers some empirical evidence on enriching the understanding of activity-space-based segregation research as well as improving the understanding about social segregation among the residents of different types of housing in Chinese cities. It also generates some nuanced knowledge for future policy recommendations in a broad context.},

	abstract = {The mobility patterns and trip behavior of people are usually extracted from data collected by traditional survey methods. However, these methods are generally costly and difficult to implement, especially in developing cities with limited resources. The massive amounts of call detail record (CDR) data passively generated by ubiquitous mobile phone usage provide researchers with the opportunity to innovate alternative methods that are inexpensive and easier and faster to implement than traditional methods. This paper proposes a method based on proven techniques to extract the origin{\textendash}destination (OD) trips from the raw CDR data of mobile phone users and process the data to capture the mobility of those users. The proposed method was applied to 3.4 million mobile phone users over a 12-day period in Mozambique, and the data processed to capture the mobility of people living in the Greater Maputo metropolitan area in different time frames (weekdays and weekends). Subsequently, trip generation maps, attraction maps, and the OD matrix of the study area, which are all practically usable for urban and transportation planning, were generated. Furthermore, spatiotemporal interpolation was applied to all OD trips to reconstruct the population distribution in the study area on an average weekday and weekend. Comparison of the results obtained with actual survey results from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) indicate that the proposed method achieves acceptable accuracy. The proposed method and study demonstrate the efficacy of mining big data sources, particularly mobile phone CDR data, to infer the spatiotemporal human mobility of people in a city and understand their flow pattern, which is valuable information for city planning.},

	abstract = {Many real networks in nature and society share two generic properties: they are scale-free and they display a high degree of clustering. We show that the scalefree nature and high clustering of real networks are the consequence of a hierarchical organization, implying that small groups of nodes form increasingly large groups in a hierarchical manner, while maintaining a scale-free topology. In hierarchical networks the clustering coefficient follows a strict scaling law, which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical organization in real networks. We find that several real networks, such as the World Wide Web, actor network, the Internet at the domain level and the semantic web obey this scaling law, indicating that hierarchy is a fundamental characteristic of many complex systems. We the focus on the metabolic network of 43 distinct organisms and show that many small, highly connected topologic modules combine in a hierarchical manner into larger, less cohesive units, their number and degree of clustering following a power law. Within Escherichia Coli we find that the uncovered hierarchical modularity closely overlaps with known metabolic functions.},

	abstract = {Machine learning methods, specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have emerged as an integral part of scientific research in many disciplines. However, these powerful methods often fail to perform pattern analysis and knowledge mining with spatial vector data because in most cases, such data are not underlying grid-like or array structures but can only be modeled as graph structures. The present study introduces a novel graph convolution by converting it from the vertex domain into a point-wise product in the Fourier domain using the graph Fourier transform and convolution theorem. In addition, the graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) architecture is proposed to analyze graph-structured spatial vector data. The focus of this study is the classical task of building pattern classification, which remains limited by the use of design rules and manually extracted features for specific patterns. The spatial vector data representing grouped buildings are modeled as graphs, and indices for the characteristics of individual buildings are investigated to collect the input variables. The pattern features of these graphs are directly extracted by training labeled data. Experiments confirmed that the GCNN produces satisfactory results in terms of identifying regular and irregular patterns, and thus achieves a significant improvement over existing methods. In summary, the GCNN has considerable potential for the analysis of graphstructured spatial vector data as well as scope for further improvement.},

	abstract = {Cities have been studied as geo-social systems embedded with intricate and complicated spatial and social networks (e.g., transportation, telecommunication, and internet). In addition to the duo of spatial and social aspects, semantics, which study the logic aspects of meanings behind behaviours and phenomena, come underneath as the latent information (e.g., activity types of people) to enrich the geosocial models for spatial phenomena. For example, individual-level similarity of semantic trajectories for location-based social networks can be used to recommend potential friends or develop collaborative travels. Semantics infer the activity behind people{\textquoteright}s spatial choices and the functions of places, transform coordinates of trajectories/spatial flows into certain types of activities, and remark locations in space with meaningful labels of functions of cities. Although the interconnections of spatial, social, and semantic domains are widely observed, the deeper theoretical integration of geography, social network, and semantic spaces, as well as the corresponding research challenges, is not yet sufficient for a comprehensive understanding of urban systems. In order to address this gap, this work proposes a novel theoretical framework for the integration of semantic perspective into geographic and social network perspectives applied to understanding urban systems. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages in terms of available data sets in urban studies within the theoretical framework. We also discuss research challenges in terms of integrating heterogeneous data sources and creating innovative analytical approach based on the theoretical framework. We believe that the proposed theoretical framework can shed light on a wide range of urban related research fields and decision-making, such as transportation, public health, urban planning, and emergency management.},

Over the last couple of decades, as a sustainable means of public transportation, urban rail transit presents a rapid development in China. Increasing initiatives and practices have been engaged with views to facilitating people{\textquoteright}s travel and intensive utilizing land resources. Echoing this, rail transit stations with multi-floor structure have been built and show structure complexity. Due to this complexity, there is a need to focus on risk management for the stations to guarantee operation safety. Accordingly, this research introduces an innovative approach to identify high-risk nodes in the complex rail transit stations. The high-risk nodes are determined according to two aspects, which are the key nodes of the station and presenting large passenger volumes. Complex network analysis and field investigation were adopted in this study. The Lianglukou rail transit station in Chongqing, China was selected for case study. The research results in this study indicate that (1) in platform floors, stairs/escalators are almost high-risk nodes; (2) columns and metal fences that have been determined as high-risk nodes are located near stairs/escalators; (3) in concourse floor, the determined high-risk nodes present relative high degree centrality and low betweenness centrality compared with nodes in platform floor. The obtained high-risk nodes are helpful for the management firms to develop risk mitigation measures and re-allocate their resources to create a safe environment for passengers in the stations. The guarantee for the rail transit station operation safety plays an important role in enhancing urban sustainability.},

In this paper we present a feature set drawn from three different mathematical heritages: the convex hull of activity space, the fractal dimension of the recorded GPS traces, and the entropy rate of individual paths. We analyze these features against three human mobility datasets. Taken together these features can distinguish datasets with known demographic or geographic differences, while equating datasets which have similar demography and geography.},

This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling.},

	title = {Inferring {Inter}-city {Trip} {Purpose} from the {Perspective} of the {Group}},
	abstract = {Although trip purpose inference based on passively collected data has long been investigated, less attention has been paid to inter-city trips. The reason is, except using ticket sales data, only limited trips can be extracted due to the lower frequency of inter-city trips during daily life. However, for ticket sales data, only limited features can be explored due to the lower spatial resolution of trajectories. Therefore, this paper endeavoured to exploit the potential of ticket sales data from the perspective of the group. Theoretically, by introducing concepts of text mining, the trip purpose of a group can be viewed as analogous to the topics of a document. Trip purpose was characterized by a time topic model (TTM) that incorporates start time, in contrast to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). This approach was implemented via a three-step method. First, groups were reconstructed from tickets. Second, three types of features, i.e., demographic, experience and co-travel network features, were extracted as a series of words to describe passengers. Third, trip purposes were automatically clustered based on the co-occurrence of words in the same group using a TTM. This paper presents comparison experiments to evaluate feature sets and the model performance based on a web -based travel survey, including the ground truth. Moreover, this paper highlights the practical use of a TTM to detect anomalies beyond anticipated trip purpose based on large-scale ticket sales data collected from Beijing, China. The full feature set was found to be preferable since both precision and recall increased when demographic and co-travel network features were considered. Meanwhile, the TTM produced robust and balanced predictions and exhibited additional power to recognize personal business compared with baseline methods.},

Results suggest that the declaration of the State of Emergency in mid-March and the home-or-work order in early-April have an immediate impact on human mobility in South Carolina. The decrease of daily new cases in mid-April and the relatively low daily new cases in May indicate that the reduced mobility, together with other mitigation measures taken by the state, have effectively contained the initial phase of the outbreak in April and May. We also find that the increase in human mobility has a positive association with the number of COVID-19 cases with a delayed effect at both state level and county level.

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present a bibliometric analysis of the applications of Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the context of public health from 2009 to 2018. A systematic review of the literature was conducted considering three major scientific databases: Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct. This enabled an analysis of the number of papers by journal, the countries where the applications were carried out, which databases are more commonly used, the most studied topics in public health, and the techniques, programming languages and software applications most frequently used by researchers. Our results showed a slight increase in the number of papers published in 2014 and a significative increase since 2017, focusing mostly on infectious, parasitic and communicable diseases, chronic diseases and risk factors for chronic diseases. The Journal of Medical Internet Research and PLoS ONE published the highest number of papers. Support Vector Machines (SVM) were the most common technique, while R and WEKA were the most common programming language and software application, respectively. The U.S. was the most common country where the studies were conducted. In addition, Twitter was the most frequently used source of data by researchers. Hence, this paper provides an overview of the literature on DM and ML in the field of public health and serves as a starting point for beginner and experienced researchers interested in this topic.},

The analysis of the complexity of functional urban spaces evolution is valuable for a deeper understanding of the changes in urban spatial structure. Taking the central city of Changchun as the study area, the paper uses the urban land conversion method to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of functional urban spaces evolution in different aspects. The study found that the evolution of functional urban spaces presents significant spatial and temporal differences in different stages and different aspects. There is a close relationship between functional urban spaces evolution and scale. As the scale becomes smaller, the spatial differences and patterns of functional urban spaces evolution become more complex. In the context of rapid urbanization, the mutual replacement of functional urban spaces is frequent, which is not conducive to the sustainable development of urban space as a whole. This study will deepen the understanding of the evolution of urban spatial structure and the complexity of urban systems and provide theoretical support for the optimization and sustainable development of urban spaces.},

	abstract = {Taxi services provide an urban transport option to citizens. Massive taxi trajectories contain rich information for understanding human travel activities, which are essential to sustainable urban mobility and transportation. The origin and destination (O-D) pairs of urban taxi trips can reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility and then offer fundamental information to interpret and reform formal, functional, and perceptual regions of cities. Matrices are one of the most effective models to represent taxi trajectories and O-D trips. Among matrix representations, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) gives meaningful interpretations of complex latent relationships. However, the independence assumption for observations is violated by spatial and temporal autocorrelation in taxi flows, which is not compensated in classical NMF models. In order to discover human intra-urban mobility patterns, a novel spatiotemporal constraint NMF (STC-NMF) model that explicitly solves spatial and temporal dependencies is proposed in this paper. It factorizes taxi flow matrices in both spatial and temporal aspects, thus revealing inherent spatiotemporal patterns. With three-month taxi trajectories harvested in Beijing, China, the STC-NMF model is employed to investigate taxi travel patterns and their spatial interaction modes. As the results, four departure patterns, three arrival patterns, and eight spatial interaction patterns during weekdays and weekends are discovered. Moreover, it is found that intensive movements within certain time windows are significantly related to region functionalities and the spatial interaction flows exhibit an obvious distance decay tendency. The outcome of the proposed model is more consistent with the inherent spatiotemporal characteristics of human intra-urban movements. The knowledge gained in this research would be useful to taxi services and transportation management for promoting sustainable urban development.},

	abstract = {Objective: This work aims to provide a review of the existing literature in the field of automated machine learning (AutoML) to help healthcare professionals better utilize machine learning models {\textquotedblleft}off-the-shelf{\textquotedblright} with limited data science expertise. We also identify the potential opportunities and barriers to using AutoML in healthcare, as well as existing applications of AutoML in healthcare.
Methods: Published papers, accompanied with code, describing work in the field of AutoML from both a computer science perspective or a biomedical informatics perspective were reviewed. We also provide a short summary of a series of AutoML challenges hosted by ChaLearn.
Results: A review of 101 papers in the field of AutoML revealed that these automated techniques can match or improve upon expert human performance in certain machine learning tasks, often in a shorter amount of time. The main limitation of AutoML at this point is the ability to get these systems to work efficiently on a large scale, i.e. beyond small- and medium-size retrospective datasets. Discussion: The utilization of machine learning techniques has the demonstrated potential to improve health outcomes, cut healthcare costs, and advance clinical research. However, most hospitals are not currently deploying machine learning solutions. One reason for this is that health care professionals often lack the machine learning expertise that is necessary to build a successful model, deploy it in production, and integrate it with the clinical workflow. In order to make machine learning techniques easier to apply and to reduce the demand for human experts, automated machine learning (AutoML) has emerged as a growing field that seeks to automatically select, compose, and parametrize machine learning models, so as to achieve optimal performance on a given task and/or dataset.
Conclusion: While there have already been some use cases of AutoML in the healthcare field, more work needs to be done in order for there to be widespread adoption of AutoML in healthcare.},

	abstract = {Existing studies suggest {\textquotedblleft}distance decay{\textquotedblright} as an important geographic property of online social networks. Namely, social interactions are more likely to occur among people that are closer in physical space. However, limited effort has been devoted so far to quantifying the impact of {\textquotedblleft}homophily{\textquotedblright} forces on social network structures. In this study, we provide a quantitative understanding of the joint impact of geographic distance and people{\textquoteright}s socioeconomic characteristics on their interaction patterns. By coupling large scale mobile phone, income and housing price datasets in Singapore, we reconstruct a spatially embedded social network that captures the cellphone communications of millions of phone users in the city. By associating phone users with their estimated residence, we introduce two indicators (communication intensity and friendship probability) to examine the cellphone interactions among places with various housing price values. Our findings suggest that, after controlling for distance, similar places tend to have relatively higher communication intensity than dissimilar ones, confirming a significant {\textquotedblleft}homophily{\textquotedblright} effect as a determinant of communication intensity. However, when the analysis is focused on the formation of social ties, the {\textquotedblleft}homophily{\textquotedblright} effect is more nuanced. It persists at relatively short distances, while at higher distances a tendency to form ties with people in the highest social classes prevails. Overall, the results reported in this study have implications for understanding social segregation in cities. In particular, the physical separation of social groups in a city (e.g., residential segregation) will have a direct impact on shaping communication or social network segregation. The study highlights the importance of incorporating socioeconomic data to the understanding of spatial-social networks.},

	abstract = {Sustainable roofs, such as those with greenery and photovoltaic panels, contribute significantly to the roadmap for reducing the carbon footprint of cities. However, research on sustainable urban roofscapes is rather focused on their potential and is hindered by the scarcity of data, limiting our understanding of their current content, spatial distribution, and temporal evolution. To tackle this issue, we introduce Roofpedia, a set of three contributions: (i) automatic mapping of relevant urban roof typology from satellite imagery; (ii) an open roof registry mapping the spatial distribution and area of solar and green roofs of more than one million buildings across 17 cities; and (iii) the Roofpedia Index, a derivative from the registry, to benchmark the cities by the extent of sustainable roofscape in term of solar and green roof penetration. This project, partly inspired by its street greenery counterpart {\textendash} Treepedia, is made possible by a multi-step pipeline that combines deep learning and geospatial techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of an automated methodology that generalises successfully across cities with an accuracy of detecting sustainable roofs of up to 100\% in some cities. We offer our results as an interactive map and open dataset so that our work could aid researchers, local governments, and the public to uncover the pattern of sustainable rooftops across cities, track and monitor the current use of rooftops, complement studies on their potential, evaluate the effectiveness of existing incentives, and ultimately support better policies and strategies to increase the adoption of instruments contributing to the sustainable development of cities.},

	abstract = {Rapid and accurate disaster impact assessment is crucial for disaster emergency decision-making. The perception and behavioral characteristics of people derived from crowdsourced data, such as social media and mobile phone signaling data, can provide information sources for disaster assessment and assist disaster emergency manage- ment. This topic has attracted extensive attention from scholars. However, these data types are incomplete and have wide-ranging quality, which makes it difficult to evaluate the disaster. Social media data contain many public descriptions of disasters, but the spatial distribution is uneven. Mobile phone signaling data cover a wide range and are spatiotemporal continuous, but semantic information is lacking. Thus, this paper develops a disaster impact assessment method that integrates social media data and mobile signaling data based on a classification of social media data with a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN), anomaly detection in mobile signaling data, and feature mining of human activity. The result shows that social media and mobile signaling data complement each other well. The proposed method improves the assessment accuracy and provides detailed information on the spatial distribution of disasters. The results of this study provide reference for the combination of different sources of information for disaster response decisions.},

	abstract = {Crime and perception of safety are two intertwined concepts affecting the quality of life and the economic development of a society. However, few studies have quantitatively examined the difference between the two due to the lack of granular data documenting public perceptions in a given geographic context. Here, by applying a pre-trained scene understanding algorithm, we infer the perception of safety score of streetscapes for census block groups in the city of Houston using a large number of Google Street View images. Then, using this inferred perception of safety, we create {\textquotedblleft}perception bias{\textquotedblright} categories for each census block group. These categories capture the level of mismatch between people{\textquoteright}s visually perceived safety and the actual crime rates. This measure provides scalable guidance in deciphering the relationship between the built environment and crime. Finally, we construct a series of models to examine the {\textquotedblleft}perception bias{\textquotedblright} with static and dynamic urban factors, including socioeconomic features (e.g., unemployment rate and ethnic compositions), urban diversity (e.g., number and diversity of Points of Interest), and urban livelihood (i.e., hourly count of visitors). Analytical and numerical results suggest that the association between characteristics of urban space and {\textquotedblleft}perception bias{\textquotedblright} over crime could be paradoxical. On the one hand, neighborhoods with a higher volume of day-time visitors appear more likely to be safer than it looks (low crime rate and low safety score). On the other hand, those with a higher volume of night-time visitors are likely to be more dangerous than it looks (high crime rate). The findings add further knowledge to the long-recognized relationship between built environment and crime as well as highlight the perception of safety in cities, which in turn enhances our capacity to design urban management strategies that prevent the emergence of extreme {\textquotedblleft}perception bias{\textquotedblright}.},

Despite many previous studies devoted to investigating urban expansion patterns and mechanisms, the spatial-temporal dynamics of driving forces and their regional differences have not been well-documented. This study examines drivers of urban expansion and their effects across different regions in China in different periods. A spatial Probit model is employed, with data selected based on a national-level sampling strategy, to model urban expansion probability from a spatially explicit perspective. Results indicate that multiple factors including socioeconomic, physical, proximity, accessibility, and neighborhood factors have driven urban expansion in China. Driving factors for urban expansion vary between national and regional levels, suggesting that analyses on different spatial scales are necessary. The dynamics and driving forces of urban expansion in China have been spatial heterogeneous. Furthermore, driving forces have trended toward more diversity over time, and the constraining effects of natural conditions on urban expansion have gradually decayed. These findings aid in gaining a better understanding of the urban expansion process in China, which will in turn benefit urban planning and management across different regions. Lastly, important policy implications are inferred.},

Second, the core area of the megacity region can be defined as a continuous high-density area by applying incoming employment density as a functional linkage. We use local spatial autocorrelation to define the hotspots of continuous high-density areas and identify a Shanghai-centered continuous high-value area. Third, we choose an algorithm that gradually increases the density threshold based on the results of local spatial autocorrelation to eliminate areas with weak functional connectivity, and delineate the boundary of the core area of the Shanghai megacity region.

By analyzing a mobile positioning dataset that captures the nationality and movement patterns of foreign tourists to South Korea, we employ a few metrics to quantify the network properties of tourism destinations, aiming to reveal the collective dynamics of tourist movements and key differences across nationalities. According to the results, the number of inbound tourists to destinations follows a log-normal distribution, which indicates a notable heterogeneity of destination attractiveness. Although this finding holds across different nationalities, we find that tourists from different countries tended to visit different places in South Korea. A community detection algorithm partitions South Korea into several tourism regions, each covering a set of destinations that are closely connected by tourist flows. The implications for transportation development and regional tourism planning are discussed.},

Existing studies using mobile phone data revealed distinct and recurrent transitional activity patterns, known as mobility motifs, in people{\textquoteright}s daily lives. The limitation in using only a few inferred activity types hinders our ability to examine general patterns in detail. We proposed a mobility network approach with geographic context-aware Twitter data to investigate granular daily activity patterns in the urban environment. We first used publicly accessible geolocated tweets to track the movements of individuals in two major U.S. cities, Chicago and Greater Boston, where each recorded location is associated with its closest land use parcel to enrich its geographic context. A direct mobility network represents the daily location history of the selected active users, where the nodes are physical places with semantically labeled activity types and the edges represent the transitions. Analyzing the isomorphic structure of the mobility networks uncovered sixteen types of location-based motifs, which describe over 83 percent of the networks in both cities and are comparable to those from previous studies. With detailed and semantically labeled transitions between every two activities, we further dissected the general location-based motifs into activity-based motifs, where sixteen common activity-based motifs describe more than 57 percent of transitional behaviors in the daily activities in the two cities. The integration of geographic context from the synthesis of geolocated Twitter data with land use parcels enables us to reveal unique activity motifs that form the fundamental elements embedded in complex urban activities.},

	abstract = {Urban functional zones (UFZs) are essential for characterizing both urban spatial configurations and socio-economic properties and monitoring urbanization process, thus UFZs are fundamental to urban planning, management and renewal. Although many efforts in remote sensing field have been made to map UFZs, large-scale and fine-grained UFZ maps required by a broad range of urban applications are still unavailable. Existing methods generally rely on pre-determined mapping units, such as image tiles and road blocks, which significantly limit the mapping quality and the automation degree of mapping UFZs. Given that UFZs are composed of diverse geographic objects, this study proposes a novel object-based UFZ mapping method using very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. First, a multi-scale semantic segmentation network that achieves pixel-wised predictions is proposed to predict urban-functions for geographic objects by capturing multi-scale contextual information. Afterwards, a conditional random field (CRF) framework is designed to regroup objects into UFZs to produce the final UFZ map, wherein road vectors are incorporated to restrict the procedure. The presented object-as-analysis-unit scheme conquers the drawbacks of mapping-unit pre-determination and the semantic segmentation model provides accurate function information for objects, thus they can be applied for producing large-scale and fine-grained UFZ maps. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by producing UFZ maps for Beijing and Shanghai, China, and competitive results with overall accuracy of 91.6\% and 89.1\% are achieved, respectively. Finally, the generated UFZ maps are utilized to analyze the urban-function structures of the two cities. The proposed method can be regarded as a significant development that appears to be promising and practical for mapping UFZ maps for real-world urban applications.},

	abstract = {A city is a complex system that never sleeps; it constantly changes, and its internal mobility (people, vehicles, goods, information, etc.) continues to accelerate and intensify. These changes and mobility vary in terms of the attributes of the city, such as space, time and cultural affiliation, which characterise to some extent how the city functions. Traditional urban studies have successfully modelled the {\textquoteleft}low-frequency city{\textquoteright} and have provided solutions such as urban planning and highway design for long-term urban development. Nevertheless, the existing urban studies and theories are insufficient to model the dynamics of a city{\textquoteright}s intense mobility and rapid changes, so they cannot tackle short-term urban problems such as traffic congestion, real-time transport scheduling and resource management. The advent of information and communication technology and big data presents opportunities to model cities with unprecedented resolution. Since 2018, a paradigm shift from modelling the {\textquoteleft}low-frequency city{\textquoteright} to the so-called {\textquoteleft}high-frequency city{\textquoteright} has been introduced, but hardly any research investigated methods to estimate a city{\textquoteright}s frequency. This work aims to propose a framework for the identification and analysis of indicators to model and better understand the concept of a high-frequency city in a systematic manner. The methodology for this work was based on a content analysis-based review, taking into account specific criteria to ensure the selection of indicator sets that are consistent with the concept of the frequency of cities. Twenty-two indicators in five groups were selected as indicators for a high-frequency city, and a framework was proposed to assess frequency at both the intra-city and inter-city levels. This work would serve as a pilot study to further illuminate the ways that urban policy and operations can be adjusted to improve the quality of city life in the context of a smart city.},

Although location-based services (LBS) and other mobile technology have rapidly grown in recent years, it can be challenging to infer meaningful places from such data, which {\textendash} compared to conventional datasets {\textendash} can be devoid of context. Existing approaches are often developed ad-hoc and can lack transparency and reproducibility. To address this, we introduce an R package for inferring home locations from LBS data. The package implements pre-existing algorithms and provides building blocks to make writing algorithmic {\textquoteleft}recipes{\textquoteright} more convenient. We evaluate this approach by analyzing a de-identified LBS dataset from Singapore that aims to balance ethics and privacy with the research goal of identifying meaningful locations. We show that ensemble approaches, combining multiple algorithms, can be especially valuable in this regard as the resulting patterns of inferred home locations closely correlate with the distribution of residential population. We hope this package, and others like it, will contribute to an increase in use and sharing of comparable algorithms, research code and data. This will increase transparency and reproducibility in mobility analyses and further the ongoing discourse around ethical big data research.},

Previous studies investigated the mechanism of human mobility by constructing spatial mobility motifs based on mobile phone datasets, but ignored their temporal characteristics. To compensate for this, this study extracted temporal stay patterns based on spatial mobility motifs. Using mobile phone location data from Shenzhen, China, we identified stop location sequences for users and constructed home-based mobility motifs according to predefined rules, and observed that approximately 97\% of users can be characterized by the 10 identified home-based mobility motifs. We designed a method to quantify the similarity of temporal stay characteristics, and the primary temporal stay patterns were extracted by classifying users with similar stay rhythms. Our results enrich the knowledge of human travel behavior from both spatial and temporal perspectives.},

	abstract = {The accurate delineation of urban agglomeration boundary is conductive to not only the better understanding of the development relationship between cities in urban agglomeration but also to the guidance of regional functions as well as the formulation of regional management policies. At the same time, the fusion of land relations and urban internal relations can greatly improve the accuracy of the delineation of urban agglomeration boundary. Still, for all that, previous studies delineated the boundary only from the perspective of land relations. In this study, firstly, wavelet transform is used to fuse Night-time Light data (NTL), POI (Point of Interest) data and Tencent Migration data, respectively. Then, the image is segmented by multiresolution segmentation to delineate the urban agglomeration boundary of GBA. Finally, the results are verified. The results show that the accuracy of urban agglomeration boundary delineated by NTL data is 85.57\%, with the Kappa value as 0.6256, respectively. While, after fusing POI data, the accuracy is 88.97\%, with the Kappa value as 0.7011, respectively. What is more, the accuracy of delineating urban agglomeration boundary by continuous fusion of population movement data reaches 93.60\%, and that of Kappa value as 0.8155. Therefore, it can be concluded that compared with delineating the boundary of urban agglomeration only based on land relations, the fusion of population movement data of urban agglomerations by wavelet transform strengthens the interconnection between cities in urban agglomeration and contributes to the accurate division of urban agglomeration boundaries. What is more, such accurate delineation not only has important practical value for optimizing the spatial structure of urban agglomerations, but also assists in the formulation of regional management and development planning policies.},

This study proposes panel data analysis to model spatiotemporal CO2 emission dynamics at a higher resolution in China by integrating the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program{\textquoteright}s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light (NSL) data with statistic data of CO2 emissions. Spatiotemporal CO2 emission dynamics were assessed from national scale down to regional and urban agglomeration scales. The evaluation showed that there was a true positive correlation between NSL data and statistic CO2 emissions in China at the provincial level from 1997 to 2012, which could be suitable for estimating CO2 emissions at 1 km resolution. The spatiotemporal CO2 emission dynamics between different regions varied greatly. The high-growth type and high-grade of CO2 emissions were mainly distributed in the Eastern region, Shandong Peninsula and Middle south of Liaoning, with clearly lower concentrations in the Western region, Central region and Sichuan{\textendash}Chongqing. The results of this study will enhance the understanding of spatiotemporal variations of CO2 emissions in China. They will provide a scientific basis for policy-making on viable CO2 emission mitigation policies.},

This study attempts to detect spatiotemporal dynamics of global EPC using the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program{\textquoteright}s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light (NSL) data. The global NSL data from 1992 to 2013 were intercalibrated via a modified invariant region (MIR) method. The global EPC at 1 km resolution was then modeled using the intercalibrated NSL data to assess spatiotemporal dynamics of EPC from a global scale down to continental and national scales. The results showed that the MIR method not only reduced the saturated lighted pixels, but also improved the continuity and comparability of the NSL data. An accuracy assessment was undertaken and confined that the intercalibrated NSL data were relatively suitable and accurate for estimating EPC in the world. Spatiotemporal variations of EPC were mainly identified in Europe, North America, and Asia. Special attention should be paid to China where the high grade and high-growth type of EPC covered 0.409\% and 1.041\% of the total country area during the study period, respectively. The results of this study greatly enhance the understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics of global EPC at the multiple scales.

The emergence of geospatial big data (GBD), increased the availability of remotely sensed (RS) data and the development of new methods for data integration to provide new opportunities for mapping types of urban land use. However, the modes of RS and GBD integration are diverse due to the differences in data, study areas, classifiers, etc. In this context, this study aims to summarize the main methods of data integration and evaluate them via a case study of urban land use mapping in Hangzhou, China. We first categorized the RS and GBD integration methods into decision-level integration (DI) and feature-level integration (FI) and analyzed their main differences by reviewing the existing literature. The two methods were then applied for mapping urban land use types in Hangzhou city, based on urban parcels derived from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network, 10 m Sentinel-2A images, and points of interest (POI). The corresponding classification results were validated quantitatively and qualitatively using the same testing dataset. Finally, we illustrated the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches via bibliographic evidence and quantitative analysis. The results showed that: (1) The visual comparison indicates a generally better performance of DI-based classification than FI-based classification; (2) DI-based urban land use mapping is easy to implement, while FI-based land use mapping enables the mixture of features; (3) DI-based and FI-based methods can be used together to improve urban land use mapping, as they have different performances when classifying different types of land use. This study provides an improved understanding of urban land use mapping in terms of the RS and GBD integration strategy.},

This study assimilates two datasets and diagnoses the spatial heterogeneity in administrative city scale based on built-up area tendencies, temporal heterogeneity in pixel scale based on nighttime light intensity tendencies, and GDP associated spatiotemporal variability over the Yangtze River Delta comparing the first two decades of this century (2001{\textendash}2010 versus 2011{\textendash}2019). The analysis reveals the following main results: (1) The built-up areas have generally increased in the second period with the center of fast expansion moving southward, including Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Nanjing, and Hefei. (2) Urban development in the original city core has saturated and is spilling over to the suburbs and countryside, leading to nighttime light intensity tendency shift from a {\textquotedblleft}rapid to moderate{\textquotedblright} and a {\textquotedblleft}moderate to rapid{\textquotedblright} development (a {\textquotedblleft}hot to cold{\textquotedblright} and a {\textquotedblleft}cold to hot{\textquotedblright} spatial clustering distribution). (3) The tendency shifts of built-up area and nighttime light intensity occur most frequently in 2010, after which the urban development is transforming from light intensity growth to built-up area growth, particularly in the developed city cores. The urban agglomeration process with nighttime light intensity reaching saturation prior to the urban development spreading into the surrounding suburbs and countryside, appears to be a suitable model, which provides insights in addressing related environmental problems and contribute to regional sustainable urban planning and management.},

The increasing availability of geo-located big data detailing human population dynamics provides a good opportunity to explore the association between anthropogenic nocturnal luminosity and corresponding human activities, especially at fine time/space scales. In this study, we used Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day/night band (DNB)\&ndash;derived nighttime light images and the gridded number of location requests (NLR) from China\&rsquo;s largest social media platform to investigate the quantitative relationship between nighttime light radiances and human population dynamics across China at four levels: the provincial, city, county, and pixel levels. Our results show that the linear relationship between the NTL and NLR might vary with the observation level and magnitude. The dispersion between the two variables likely increases with the observation scale, especially at the pixel level. The effect of spatial autocorrelation and other socioeconomic factors on the relationship should be taken into account for nighttime light-based measurements of human activities. Furthermore, the bivariate relationship between the NTL and NLR was employed to generate a partition of human settlements based on the combined features of nighttime lights and human population dynamics. Cross-regional comparisons of the partitioned results indicate a diverse co-distribution of the NTL and NLR across various types of human settlements, which could be related to the city size/form and urbanization level. Our findings may provide new insights into the multi-level responses of nighttime light signals to human activity and the potential application of nighttime light data in association with geo-located big data for investigating the spatial patterns of human settlement.},

The results showed that high-speed rail had a negative effect on long-term population migration and significantly promoted short-term population mobility, leading to a negative effect on the population urbanisation; from the perspective of industrial structure, high-speed rail increased the proportion of the added value of the tertiary industry, promoted the upgrading of industrial structure, and consequently improved the quality of urbanisation.},

The main results are presented as follows. 1) Opening HSR can positively influence urban land expansion, as evidenced by the 9.5\% increase in the urban land expansion index after such opening. 2) The increase in the number of HSR station and route can accelerate urban land expansion. Each newly added station increases the urban land expansion index by 2.4\%, and urban land expansion increases 4.8\% when a new HSR route is added. 3) The positive effects of the opening of HSR on urban land expansion generally have a time lag of five years. 4) Compared with cities in the east, the midwestern ones are more vulnerable to the impact of HSR. The net effect of HSR on urban land expansion for midwestern cities is 10.9\% higher than that for cities in the east. Furthermore, the mechanisms of the effect of HSR on urban land expansion are the industrial agglomeration effect of HSR and the incentive effect of local governments{\textquoteright} land finance alongside the development of HSR.},

The relationship between NTL intensity and human activity becomes a solid foundation for the applications using NTL data. However, there is no research, so far, revealing how the human activity seasonality could impact the seasonal change of NTL intensity. In this paper, a comparative analysis, box plot, and random forest algorithm were applied to NTL remote-sensing data and points of interest (POIs) data within Shanghai, China. The results show that in spring and autumn, the NTL is much brighter than that in summer and winter, especially within high human activity density area. The NTL intensity can be partly (approximately 40\%) explained as the joint effects of the five POI categories. By analyzing the contributions of each POI category to NTL intensity, we found that the National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) could be used to dig more information about gross domestic product (GDP) and traffic-based applications with consideration of NTL seasonality.},

	abstract = {Although there has been a rapid urbanization in China since the 1980s, the simultaneous urban shrinkage phenomenon has existed for a long time. The study of shrinking cities is particularly important for China as the current urban development has changed from physical expansion to built-up area improvement. After redefining what constitutes a city (what we term a natural city), we compared the adjusted nightlight intensity of National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) data between 2013 and 2016 to accurately identify shrinking cities throughout China. The results indicate that there are 2,862 redefined natural cities in China and that the total area reaches 53,275 km2, about 0.5\% of the national territory. Based on this, we identified 798 shrinking cities with a total area of 13,839 km2. After analyzing the relative position of shrinking cities and internal shrinking pixels in the geometric space, the morphological characteristics of shrinking cities were systematically classified into six patterns. The majority of shrinking cities belong to scatter shrinkage, central shrinkage, and local shrinkage; only 5\% are complete shrinkage; the rest are unilateral shrinkage and peripheral shrinkage. In addition, six shrinkage causes were quantitatively classified and summarized by referring to multiple-source urban data and municipal yearbooks. To enrich the methodological system for urban shrinkage, the research provides a reminder of the need to consider the other side of urbanization (i.e., dissolution of social networks) and proposes appropriate strategies and policies to address shrinkage issues.},

	abstract = {Studying the generation and development of urban areas is of great significance to improve our understanding of urbanization. However, it is still difficult to explore the spatial-temporal dynamic characteristics of urban agglomeration in the global scope. The easily accessible night-time light (NTL) data provide a window to observe the progress of human urban development from space. This study proposes a method based on NTL-Internet data. By combining the NTL center of gravity and the interregional link index model, it is used to detect the spatial expansion characteristics of the Yangtze river delta urban agglomeration (YRDUA), thus completing the comprehensive exploration of the urbanization in YRDUA. Results demonstrate that YRDUA, compared with the five major urban agglomerations in Europe, North America, and Asia, maintains the greatest urbanization potential. Further analysis shows that the urban area of Hefei has a huge development momentum. In addition, the urbanization level of YRDUA is easily affected by national planning, which conforms to the model of urban expansion, including infilling, edge expansion, and leapfrogging in different metropolitan areas. Finally, the link index model based on Internet data is utilized to quantitatively calculate the relevance of various cities in YRDUA. The results not only confirm the findings based on the NTL data but also explain that those metropolitan areas play a complementary and indivisible role in the urbanization process of YRDUA. This study will provide a framework for other research works to assess the spatial-temporal changes in urban characteristics, which is beyond the scope of a single city.},

	abstract = {Nighttime light imagery offers a unique view of the Earth{\textquoteright}s surface. In the past, the nighttime light data collected by the DMSP-OLS sensors have been used as an efficient means to correlate regional and global socio-economic activities. With the launch of the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) satellite in 2011, the day-night band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard represents a major advancement in nighttime imaging capabilities, because it surpasses its predecessor DMSP-OLS in radiometric accuracy, spatial resolution and geometric quality. In this paper, four variables (total night light, light area, average night light and log average night light) are extracted from nighttime radiance data observed by the VIIRS-DNB composite in 2013 and nighttime digital number (DN) data from the DMSP-OLS stable dataset in 2012, respectively, and correlated with 12 socio-economic parameters at the provincial level in mainland China during the corresponding period. Background noise of DNB composite data is removed using either a masking method or an optimal threshold method. In general, the correlation of these socio-economic data with the total night light and light area of VIIRS-DNB composite data is better than with the DMSP-OLS stable data. The correlations between total night light of denoised DNB composite data and built-up area, gross regional product (GRP) and power consumption are higher than 0.9 and so are the correlations between the light area of denoised DNB composite data and city and town population, built-up area, GRP, power consumption and waste water discharge. However, the correlations of socio-economic data with the average night light and log average night light of VIIRS-DNB composite data are not as good as with the DMSP-OLS stable data. To quantitatively analyze the reasons for the correlation difference, a cubic regression method is developed to correct the saturation effect of the DMSP stable data, and we artificially convert the pixel value of the DNB composite into six bits to match the DMSP stable data format. The correlation results between the processed data and socio-economic data show that the effects of saturation and quantization are two of the reasons for the correlation difference. Additionally, on this basis, we estimate the total night light ratio between saturation-corrected DMSP stable data and finite quantization DNB composite data, and it is found that the ratio is {\textasciitilde}11.28 {\textpm} 4.02 for China. Therefore, it appears that a different acquisition time is the other reason for the correlation difference.},

	abstract = {Aiming at the problem that the estimation of electric power consumption (EPC) by using night-time light (NTL) data is mostly concentrated in large areas, a method for estimating EPC in rural areas is proposed. Rural electric power consumption (REPC) is a key indicator of the national socio-economic development. Despite an improved quality of life in rural areas, there is still a big gap between electricity consumption between rural residents and urban residents in China. The experiment takes REPC as the research target, selects Dehong (DH) Dai Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province as an example, and uses the NTL data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day\&ndash;Night Band (DNB) carried by the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Satellite from 2012 to 2017, toponym and points-of-interest (POI) data as the main data source. By performing kernel density estimation to extract the urban center and rural area boundaries in the prefecture, and combining the county-level boundary data and electric power data, a linear regression model of the total rural NTL intensity and REPC is estimated. Finally, according to the model, the EPC in ethnic minority rural areas is estimated at a 1-km spatial resolution. The results show that the NPP-REPC model can simulate REPC within a small average error (17.8\%). Additionally, there are distinct spatial differences of REPC in ethnic minority areas.},

The results showed that there were obvious differences in the characteristics of urban networks from the perspective of different modes of travel. The intercity flow of aviation trips showed a core-periphery structure with national hub cities as the core distribution. Trips by train showed a core-periphery structure with cities along the national railway artery as the core. This gradually decreased toward hinterland cities.

In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV), kernel density analysis, cold hot spot analysis, trend analysis, standard deviation ellipse and Moran{\textquoteright}s I Index were used to analyze the Spatio-temporal Dynamic Evolution Characteristics of EPC in the three urban agglomerations of the YREB. In addition, we also use geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and random forest algorithm to analyze the influencing factors of EPC in the three major urban agglomerations in YREB. The results of this study show that from 1992 to 2013, the CV of the EPC in the three urban agglomerations of YREB has been declining at the overall level. At the same time, the highest EPC value is in YRDUA, followed by UAMRYR and CCUA. In addition, with the increase of time, the high-value areas of EPC hot spots are basically distributed in YRDUA. The standard deviation ellipses of the EPC of the three urban agglomerations of YREB clearly show the characteristics of {\textquotedblleft}east-west{\textquotedblright} spatial distribution. With the increase of time, the correlations and the agglomeration of the EPC in the three urban agglomerations of the YREB were both become more and more obvious. In terms of influencing factor analysis, by using GWR model, we found that the five influencing factors we selected basically have a positive impact on the EPC of the YREB. By using the Random forest algorithm, we found that the three main influencing factors of EPC in the three major urban agglomerations in the YREB are the proportion of secondary industry in GDP, Per capita disposable income of urban residents, and Urbanization rate.},

The characteristics and spatial pattern of population flow among cities are analyzed from the perspectives of the population flow distribution level, hierarchical aggregation of the distributed network system, population flow spatial patterns, and network characteristics. Three-hundred forty-six cities were divided into nine communities. The results are as follows: the net inflow routes of the population in the three periods all show a diamond-shaped skeleton supported by a cross-shaped one. The population distribution centers are mainly concentrated in the four major urban agglomerations. The clear hierarchical structure and level distinction of population distribution centers can be identified, and there is a positive correlation between the level of city administrative and the influence of population floating. Population flows of most cities are in a relatively balanced state. The degree of urban network nodes is the power-law distribution, so the network is scale free, and the network has small-world characteristic. It provides a new perspective for the study of population mobility and urban network.},

The objective of this study was to describe a reliable method of estimating urbanization level based on the Operational Line-scan System (OLS) on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) nighttime light data and to analyze the dynamics of urbanization levels in China from 1992 to 2012. We calculated the comprehensive urbanization level at the national, provincial, and county scales using a compounded night light index (CNLI) and compared the change rate of CNLI with those of the other two conventional urbanization level indicators, proportion of the nonagricultural population and proportion of built-up area. Our results showed that CNLI derived from the DMSP/OLS data set provided a relatively reliable and accurate measure of the comprehensive urbanization level in China. During the last two decades, China has experienced continued and rapid urbanization with large regional variations. The CNLI increased 3.12 times, from 1.72 {\texttimes} 10-3 to 7.09 {\texttimes} 10-3. The annual increases of CNLI in eastern provinces were much faster than those in western provinces. In addition, we found that the rates of change in these three indicators were consistent for most provinces with the exception of the four municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing) and a few eastern coastal provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong). Because the imbalance among population growth, urban expansion and socioeconomic development may affect cities{\textquoteright} sustainable development, we should pay more attention to these regions with large disparities between different indicators.},

However, most researches focus on the spatial pattern while ignoring the temporal dynamics of urbanization process.

New metrics of GNTL (growth of NTL), max GNTL, min GNTL, mean GNTL, GNTL amplitude and accumulated GNTL derived from time series DMSP/OLS data were applied to detect the urbanization dynamics of Mainland China from 1992 to 2013.The results show that NTL-derived metrics are good indicators to trace the urban dynamics on the contexts of both spatial and temporal scales, from which the urbanization dynamic features can be detected. With the combined utilization of NTL and NTL derived metrics, 3 types of urbanization are summarized, namely constant rapid urbanization, active improving urbanization and steady improving urbanization. Classification methods were also applied to test the performance of NTL derived metrics for urban structure discrimination. The study reported here is a novel attempt to trace urbanization process using the NTL derived metrics, and we foresee its wide applications in future in relevant studies.},

	abstract = {The urban population (UP) measure is one of the most direct indicators that reflect the urbanization process and the impacts of human activities. The dynamics of UP is of great importance to studying urban economic, social development, and resource utilization. Currently, China lacks long time series UP data with consistent standards and comparability over time. The nighttime light images from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program{\textquoteright}s (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) allow the acquisition of continuous and highly comparable long time series UP information. However, existing studies mainly focus on simulating the total population or population density level based on the nighttime light data. Few studies have focused on simulating the UP in China. Based on three regression models (i.e., linear, power function, and exponential), the present study discusses the relationship between DMSP/OLS nighttime light data and the UP and establishes optimal regression models for simulating the UPs of 339 major cities in China from 1990 to 2010. In addition, the present study evaluated the accuracy of UP and non-agricultural population (NAP) simulations conducted using the same method. The simulation results show that, at the national level, the power function model is the optimal regression model between DMSP/OLS nighttime light data and UP data for 1990{\textendash}2010. At the provincial scale, the optimal regression model varies among different provinces. The linear regression model is the optimal regression model for more than 60\% of the provinces. In addition, the comparison results show that at the national, provincial, and city levels, the fitting results of the UP based on DMSP/OLS nighttime light data are better than those of the NAP. Therefore, DMSP/OLS nighttime light data can be used to effectively retrieve the UP of a large-scale region. In the context of frequent population flows between urban and rural areas in China and difficulty in obtaining accurate UP data, this study provides a timely and effective method for solving this problem.},

The edges of urban areas in Zhejiang province were identified based on the distributions and values of pixels. Compared with other traditional methods, the urban regions extracted in this study present a higher overall accuracy and kappa coefficient (OA = 93.1409\%; Kappa = 0.8755). Two periods of the urban dynamic process and urban sprawl pattern in Zhejiang from 1992{\textendash}2013 were further detected by the proposed method. At city level, the drastic increase in urban areas was found in cities of Hangzhou and Ningbo. This study provides an objective and convenient solution to the accurate identification of urban regions, which is also an important step to better understand the urban dynamics and urban development.},

	abstract = {Spatially explicit and reliable data on poverty is critical for both policy makers and researchers. However, such data remain scarce particularly in developing countries. Current research is limited in using environmental data from different sources in isolation to estimate poverty despite the fact that poverty is a complex phenomenon which cannot be quantified either theoretically or practically by one single data type. This study proposes a random forest regression (RFR) model to estimate poverty at 10 km \&times; 10 km spatial resolution by combining features extracted from multiple data sources, including the National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) nighttime light (NTL) data, Google satellite imagery, land cover map, road map and division headquarter location data. The household wealth index (WI) drawn from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) program was used to reflect poverty level. We trained the RFR model using data in Bangladesh and applied the model to both Bangladesh and Nepal to evaluate the model\&rsquo;s accuracy. The results show that the R2 between the actual and estimated WI in Bangladesh is 0.70, indicating a good predictive power of our model in WI estimation. The R2 between actual and estimated WI of 0.61 in Nepal also indicates a good generalization ability of the model. Furthermore, a negative correlation is observed between the district average WI and the poverty head count ratio (HCR) in Bangladesh with the Pearson Correlation Coefficient of -0.6. Using Gini importance, we identify that proximity to urban areas is the most important variable to explain poverty which contribute to 37.9\% of the explanatory power. Compared to the study that used NTL and Google satellite imagery in isolation to estimate poverty, our method increases the accuracy of estimation. Given that the data we use are globally and publicly available, the methodology reported in this study would also be applicable in other countries or regions to estimate the extent of poverty.},

The nighttime light (NTL) data, derived from Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership, can detect the artificial light from the Earth surface, and have been used to study social-economic activities. This paper proposes a method for estimating the HVR in metropolitan areas using NPP-VIIRS NTL composite data. This method combines NTL composite data with land cover information to extract the light intensity in urbanized areas. Then, we estimate the light intensity values for nonvacancy areas, and use such values to calculate the HVR in corresponding regions. Fifteen metropolitan areas in the United States have been selected for this study, and the estimated HVR values are validated using corresponding statistical data. The experimental results show a strong correlation between our derived HVR values and the statistical data. We also visualize the estimated HVR on maps, and discover that the spatial distribution of HVR is influenced by natural situations as well as the degree of urban development.},

This paper provides an exploratory evaluation on the NPP-VIIRS data for estimating the total freight traffic (TFT) in China, in comparison with the results derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime stable light composite data. We first corrected the original NPP-VIIRS data by employing a simple method to remove the outliers. The total nighttime light (TNL) which is measured by the sum value of all pixels from the nighttime light composite data was then regressed on TFT at the provincial level of China. Finally, the spatial distribution patterns of TFT were produced from the corrected NPP-VIIRS and DMSP-OLS data, respectively, and validated by the TFT statistics of 244 prefectures. The results have demonstrated that the corrected NPP-VIIRS data are more suitable for modeling TFT in China than the DMSP-OLS data.},

This study explores the application of daily NPP-VIIRS DNB data in assessing the impact of three types of natural disasters: earthquakes, floods, and storms. Daily DNB images one month prior to and 10 days after a disastrous event were collected and a Percent of Normal Light (PNL) image was produced as the ratio of the mean DNB radiance of the pre- and post-disaster images. Areas with a PNL value lower than one were considered as being affected by the event. The results were compared with the damaged proxy map and the flood proxy map generated using synthetic aperture radar data as well as the reported power outage rates. Our analyses show that overall NPP-VIIRS DNB daily data are useful for detecting damages and power outages caused by earthquake, storm, and flood events. Cloud coverage was identified as a major limitation in using the DNB daily data; rescue activities, traffic, and socioeconomic status of the areas also affect the use of DNB daily data in assessing the impact of natural disasters. Our findings offer new insight into the use of the daily DNB data and provide a practical guide for researchers and practitioners who may consider using such data in different situations or regions.},

As new-generation data, NPP-VIIRS data have a higher spatial resolution and a wider radiometric detection range than the traditional DMSP-OLS nighttime light data. This study aims to investigate the potential of NPP-VIIRS data in modeling GDP and EPC at multiple scales through a case study of China. A series of preprocessing procedures are proposed to reduce the background noise of original data and to generate corrected NPP-VIIRS nighttime light images. Subsequently, linear regression is used to fit the correlation between the total nighttime light (TNL) (which is extracted from corrected NPP-VIIRS data and DMSP-OLS data) and the GDP and EPC (which is from the country{\textquoteright}s statistical data) at provincial- and prefectural-level divisions of mainland China. The result of the linear regression shows that R2 values of TNL from NPP-VIIRS with GDP and EPC at multiple scales are all higher than those from DMSP-OLS data. This study reveals that the NPP-VIIRS data can be a powerful tool for modeling socioeconomic indicators; such as GDP and EPC.},

Historically, using a simple regression function, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program{\textquoteright}s Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) has been used to correlate regional and global GDP values. In early 2013, the first global Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) nighttime light data were released. Compared with DMSP/OLS, they have a higher spatial resolution and a wider radiometric detection range. This paper aims to study the suitability of the two nighttime light data sources for estimating the GDP relationship between the provincial and city levels in Mainland China, as well as of different regression functions. First, NPP/VIIRS nighttime light data for 2014 are corrected with DMSP/OLS data for 2013 to reduce the background noise in the original data. Subsequently, three regression functions are used to estimate the relationship between nighttime light data and GDP statistical data at the provincial and city levels in Mainland China. Then, through the comparison of the relative residual error (RE) and the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) parameters, a systematical assessment of the suitability of the GDP estimation is provided. The results show that the NPP/VIIRS nighttime light data are better than the DMSP/OLS data for GDP estimation, whether at the provincial or city level, and that the power function and polynomial models are better for GDP estimation than the linear regression model. This study reveals that the accuracy of GDP estimation based on nighttime light data is affected by the resolution of the data and the spatial scale of the study area, as well as by the land cover types and industrial structures of the study area.},

The temporal coverage of the DMSP-OLS data spans between 1992 and 2013, while the NPP-VIIRS data are available from 2012. Integrating the two datasets to produce a time series of continuous and consistently monitored data since the 1990s is of great significance for the understanding of the dynamics of long-term economic development. In addition, since economic developmental patterns vary with physical environment and geographical location, the quantitative relationship between nighttime lights and GDP should be designed for individual regions. Through a case study in China, this study made an attempt to integrate the DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIRS datasets, as well as to identify an optimal model for long-term spatiotemporal GDP dynamics in different regions of China. Based on constructed regression relationships between total nighttime lights (TNL) data from the DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIRS data in provincial units (R2 = 0.9648, P \&lt; 0.001), the temporal coverage of nighttime light data was extended from 1992 to the present day. Furthermore, three models (the linear model, quadratic polynomial model and power function model) were applied to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of GDP in China from 1992 to 2015 at both the country level and provincial level using the extended temporal coverage data. Our results show that the linear model is optimal at the country level with a mean absolute relative error (MARE) of 11.96\%. The power function model is optimal in 22 of the 31 provinces and the quadratic polynomial model is optimal in 7 provinces, whereas the linear model is optimal only in two provinces. Thus, our approach demonstrates the potential to accurately and timely model long-term spatiotemporal GDP dynamics using an integration of DMSP-OLS and NPP-VIIRS data.},

This study provides a dasymetric approach for GDP estimation at a fine scale by combining the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime imagery, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover data. Despite the advantages of DMSP/OLS nighttime imagery in estimating human activities, its drawbacks, including coarse resolution, overglow, and saturation effects, limit its application. Hence, high-resolution EVI data were integrated with DMSP/OLS in this study to create a Human Settlement Index (HSI) for estimating the GDP of secondary and tertiary industries. The GDP of the primary industry was then estimated on the basis of land cover data, and the area with the GDP of the primary industry was classified by a threshold technique (DN <= 8). The regression model for GDP distribution estimation was implemented in Zhejiang Province in southeast China, and a GDP density map was generated at a resolution of 250 m {\texttimes} 250 m. Compared with the outcome of taking DMSP/OLS as a unique parameter, estimation errors obviously decreased. This study offers a low-cost and accurate approach for rapidly estimating  high-resolution GDP distribution to construct an important database for the government when formulating developmental strategies.},

	abstract = {Urbanization is a complex process closely involving the economy, society, and population. While monitoring urban development and exploring the industry-driving force in a real-time and effective way are the prerequisites for optimizing industry structure, narrowing the urban development gap, and achieving sustainable development. Nighttime light is an effective tool to monitor urban development from a macro perspective. However, the systematic research of nighttime light spatiotemporal variation modes and the industry-driving force of urban nighttime light are still unknown. Considering these issues, this paper analyzes the spatiotemporal variation modes of the average light index (ALI) and investigates the industry-driving force of ALI in 100 major prefecture-level cities across China mainland based on National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Satellite Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP VIIRS). The conclusions are as following three aspects. First, ALI is observed a funnel pattern among four regions in spatial dimension, with low in center and high in the surrounding, and it shows 5 variation modes (\&ldquo;W,\&rdquo; \&ldquo;\&radic;,\&rdquo; \&ldquo;Exponent,\&rdquo; \&ldquo;Logarithm,\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;N\&rdquo;) in temporal dimension, of which the \&ldquo;\&radic;\&rdquo; mode accounts for the highest proportion (60\%). Second, the industry structure is closely related to ALI. Besides, the factor analysis result illustrates that the secondary and tertiary industry are the driving industries of ALI. Third, the classification result based on the industry contribution rate indicates that cities driven by different industries show significant spatial distribution differences. The three major industry-driving cities are mainly distributed in central and western regions, the secondary and tertiary industry-driving cities are evenly distributed, and the tertiary industry-driving cities are mainly distributed in provincial capitals. From 2013 to 2018, the fluctuation of city distribution driven by different industries changes obviously. The number of tertiary industry-driving cities increases steadily and the three major industry-driving cities are distributed wider spatially. Additionally, the impacts of location and raw coal on ALI are discussed. In general, these findings are essential to further research urban development mode and can be considered as the reference to narrow urban development gap.},

Spatial and socioeconomic processes are the two key aspects of urban development, so the absence of any of them will affect the assessment of urban development status. In this study, using both spatial and socioeconomic information from land cover data and nighttime light data, respectively, we proposed an exponential model, Spatial\&ndash;Socioeconomic Urban Development Curve (SSUDC), to provide a quantitative expression of the relationship between the two key processes of urban development and analyze urban development status. The SSUDC was calculated from the artificial surface ratio at 1\% intervals obtained from Globeland30 land cover data and the corresponding average NPP-VIIRS nighttime light radiance data, using a nonlinear least-squares method. We generated SSUDCs for 330 prefecture-level cities in Mainland China, 208 of which had coefficients of determination (R2) greater than 0.6. Taking Ordos and Guiyang as two typical examples, we analyzed the importance and advantages of SSUDC. The coefficients \&alpha; and \&beta; of the exponential SSUDC were shown to indicate the base intensity socioeconomic activity and the concentration of socioeconomic activities, respectively, and can be used to reveal the urban socioeconomic development status and functional type of cities. At the internal urban level, the residuals of SSUDC can imply the demand for urban physical or economic construction in different areas of the city, and even the urban growth type, together with the distribution of the artificial surface ratio. In summary, the proposed SSUDC provides a simple way to combine the spatial and socioeconomic processes of urban development, which is beneficial to the analysis of urban development at different scales and a rewarding tool for urban planning.},

	abstract = {The satellite-observed nighttime light emission (NTLE) data provide a new method for scrutinizing the footprint of human settlements. Changing NTLEs can be attributed to the direct/indirect influences of highly complex factors that are beyond the ability of simple statistical models to distinguish. Besides, the relatively coarse resolution of the NTLE products combined with light from human settlements may produce misleading results, as the relationship between spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the growth of developed land (e.g., urban and rural residences, shopping centers, industrial parks, mining plants, and transportation facilities) and the associated NTLEs has not been adequately analyzed. In this study, we developed a total nighttime brightness index (TotalNTBI) to measure the NTLEs with the defense meteorological satellite program/operational linescan system (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light data enhanced by sharpening the edges of the pixels. Thirty-six key cities in China were selected to investigate the relationship between the total developed land area and the associated TotalNTBI from 2000 to 2013 using panel regression and a simplified structural equation model (SEM). The results show that the overall trend in TotalNTBI agreed well with that of the total developed land area (mean adjusted R2 = 0.799). The panel regression models explained approximately 71.8\% of the variance of total developed land area and 92.4\% of the variance in TotalNTBI. The SEM revealed both the direct and indirect influences of independent variables on the total developed land area and the associated TotalNTBI. This study may provide useful information for decision-makers and researchers engaged in sustainable land development, urban management, and regional developmental inequality, focusing on recent issues, such as retrospective analysis of human footprint with sharpened nighttime NTLE products, the loss of natural and semi-natural land due to the sprawling developed land area indicated by intensively lit area, and the low efficiency of land development indicated by the anomalies of developed land area and associated NTBIs.},

The accurate and rapid identification of urban functional zones is of great significance to urban planning and resource allocation. However, the factors considered in the existing functional zone identification methods are not comprehensive enough, and the recognition of functional zones stops at their categories. This paper proposes a framework that combines multisource heterogeneous data to identify the categories of functional zones and draw the portraits of functional zones. The framework comprehensively describes the features of functional zones from four aspects: building-level metrics, landscape metrics, semantic metrics, and human activity metrics, and uses a combination of ensemble learning and active learning to balance the identification accuracy of functional zones and the labeling cost during large-scale generalization. Furthermore, sentiment analysis, word cloud analysis, and land cover proportion maps are added to the portraits of typical functional zones to make the image of functional zones vivid. The experiment carried out within the Fifth Ring Road, Haidian District, Beijing, shows that the overall accuracy of the method reached 82.37\% and the portraits of the four typical functional zones are clear. The method in this paper has good repeatability and generalization, which is helpful to carry out quantitative and objective research on urban functional zones.},

In this study, we propose to tackle a novel transit mobility structure detection problem, which hinges on high-level mobility patterns that characterize collective movement dynamics across the study region. To this end, we propose a machine learning-based approach to discover meaningful urban mobility structure using big transit data. We contend that both transit mobility patterns and local urban function information should be considered during the detection of transit mobility structure. By integrating different sources of urban data, we model the network of transit mobility as an attributed graph: local static urban functions are described by attributed features for graph nodes whereas travel dynamics are captured via a transit mobility pattern matrix. Similarities of both attributed features and transit mobility patterns are jointly embedded to derive compact low-dimensional vector representations via graph auto-encoder. Mobility structure is then extracted using unsupervised clustering and gap statistics. The proposed approach is capable of synthesizing both mobility and static information in a data-driven manner, preserving original urban topological structure and resident movement dynamics. The proposed approach was evaluated using real-world transit data collected in Shenzhen City, China. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach has the applicability of unveiling meaningful transit mobility structure in large metropolitan areas. The detected mobility community maps present a holistic overview of public transit movement structure, enabling decision makers to make informed decisions on sustainable urban development and transit management.},

	abstract = {Despite the wide availability of remote sensing big data from numerous different Earth Observation (EO) instruments, the limitations in the spatial and temporal resolution of such EO sensors (as well as atmospheric opacity and other kinds of interferers) have led to many situations in which using only remote sensing data cannot fully meet the requirements of applications in which a (near) real-time response is needed. Examples of these applications include floods, earthquakes, and other kinds of natural disasters, such as typhoons. To address this issue, social media data have gradually been adopted to fill possible gaps in the analysis when remote sensing data are lacking or incomplete. In this case, the fusion of heterogeneous big data streams from multiple data sources introduces significant demands from a computational viewpoint. In order to meet these challenges, distributed computing is increasingly viewed as a feasible solution to parallelize the analysis of massive data coming from different sources (e.g., remote sensing and social media data). In this article, we provide an overview of available and new distributed strategies to address the computational challenges brought by massive heterogeneous data processing and fusion for real-time environmental monitoring and decision-making. The 2013 Boulder (Colorado) flood event is taken as a case study to evaluate several new distributed data fusion frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed distributed frameworks are suitable in terms of response time and computational requirements for fusing large-volume heterogeneous data sources.},

All numerical and theoretical results are consistent with empirical data from ten representative cities. In addition, our model can also provide a general explanation of the origins of the universal super- and sub-linear aggregate scaling laws and accurately predict kilometre-level socioeconomic activity.

It is also ultimately key to social interactions8, innovation9,10 and productivity11. However, our quantitative understanding of the aggregate movements of individuals remains incomplete. Existing models{\textemdash}such as the gravity law12,13 or the radiation model14{\textemdash}concentrate on the purely spatial dependence of mobility flows and do not capture the varying frequencies of recurrent visits to the same locations. Here we reveal a simple and robust scaling law that captures the temporal and spatial spectrum of population movement on the basis of large-scale mobility data from diverse cities around the globe. According to this law, the number of visitors to any location decreases as the inverse square of the product of their visiting frequency and travel distance. We further show that the spatio-temporal flows to different locations give rise to prominent spatial clusters with an area distribution that follows Zipf{\textquoteright}s law15. Finally, we build an individual mobility model based on exploration and preferential return to provide a mechanistic explanation for the discovered scaling law and the emerging spatial structure. Our findings corroborate long-standing conjectures in human geography (such as central place theory16 and Weber{\textquoteright}s theory of emergent optimality10) and allow for predictions of recurrent flows, providing a basis for applications in urban planning, traffic engineering and the mitigation of epidemic diseases.},

	abstract = {It is widely observed urban land expands faster than population grows, which results in declining urban population densities over time. However, it is not known how densities decline. By taking 35 major Chinese cities as examples, we propose an exponential model to quantify the temporal decline in urban population densities from 2001 to 2015. The average adjusted R2 of the exponential model for 35 cities is 0.68, indicating a moderate but powerful correlation with temporal variations in densities. The exponential model implies that the temporal decline in densities in cities is occurring at a constant but differentiated rate. Apart from Beijing and Shanghai, the annual decline rates vary from 1\% to 9\%, with an average of 4.65\%, which means urban population densities declined by 4.65\% per annum from 2001 to 2015. The bivariate correlation analysis and multiple regression model reveal that the initial urban population density and the growth rates of urban land, population, and GDP in a city are significantly correlated with the decline rates and that these four factors can explain 72.3\% of the variance in the decline rates among cities. We further verified the transferability and applicability of the exponential model by applying it to 20 U.S. cities. Using a global dataset, we found the temporal decline rate in densities in Chinese cities was greater than those in India and other countries or regions, which highlights the necessity of efficient urban development strategies to slow down the temporal decline in urban population densities in China.},

	abstract = {Urban scaling laws assume that the performance of a city largely relies on its urban population size. However, two cities with the same population size may have vastly different economic outputs, which reveals that factors apart from urban size (a measurement of intra-urban interactions) determine their economic outputs. Economic production is essentially the product of social interactions. Urban population size and interurban interactions reflected by population mobility were both considered to evaluate the scaling of urban economic outputs in this paper. We quantified the scaling relationship between urban economic outputs and interurban interactions, and compared it with the paradigm derived from urban size. Results showed that urban economic outputs scale with urban interactions across cities and present the same super-linear scaling regimes but with a greater scaling exponent. A deeper looking showed that interurban interactions definitely bring a more obvious super-linearity than population size but the scaling relationship between urban size and economic outputs is more robust. Urban population size has a greater impact on Gross Domestic Product (GDP), secondary and tertiary industries output products, total retail sales of consumer goods and total wage with 60{\textendash}~65\% relative contribution. For exports, interurban interactions and urban population size are almost equally important. We also proved that interactions between cities are significantly positively correlated with urban extra growth. These findings provide convictive evidence that in addition to population size, interurban interaction is also crucial for exploring the scaling of urban growth. Our results are enlightening to the study of mechanisms and evolutions of urban scaling that interurban interaction besides urban population size should both be a vital consideration to urban economic outputs.},

	abstract = {Numerous urban indicators scale with urban population in a system of cities. However, whether the scaling law also exists in an intra-urban system and whether the scaling law across cities can be applied in the temporal growth of individual cities are not clear. Taking Shanghai, China, as an example, we collected urban population, building areas and other urban indicators from 2005 to 2017 in districts (the secondary administrative unit of Chinese cities). The building area has a robust scaling relationship with urban population among different districts in each year, indicating that the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system composed by districts. The scaling exponent between building areas and population in the intra-urban system is less than one (sub-linear relationship), which means building areas increase more slowly than population across districts. Temporally, building areas increase faster than population in most individual districts, showing a super-linear relationship. The contrasting relationship between building area and population across districts and over time indicates that the scaling law cannot be applied in the temporal growth of individual districts or cities. In conclusion, the scaling law also exists in the intra-urban system, and the cross-sectional scaling law cannot be applied to individual parts over time. Our further analyses using GDP and other five urban indicators confirm the two findings.},

Results show that NTL overall decreased after the lockdown of cities, but with regional disparities and varying spatial patterns. Asian cities experienced the most obvious reduction of NTL. Particularly, the monthly averaged NTL in Mumbai, India, decreased by nearly 20\% compared to one month before. However, there were no significant decline in NTL in European cities. African cities also experienced stable changes of NTL. Spatially, city centers darkened more obviously than the urban periphery. Facing emergencies, NTL data has broad applications in monitoring socioeconomic dynamics and assessing public policies in a near real-time manner.},

Despite the implications for equity and emergency planning, we lack a quantitative understanding of how these social fault lines translate to different behaviours in large-scale emergency contexts. Here we investigate this problem in the context of Hurricane Harvey, using over 30 million anonymized GPS records from over 150,000 opted-in users in the Greater Houston Area to quantify patterns of disaster-inflicted relocation activities before, during, and after the shock. We show that evacuation distance is highly homogenous across individuals from different types of neighbourhoods classified by race and wealth, obeying a truncated power-law distribution. Yet here the similarities end: we find that both race and wealth strongly impact evacuation patterns, with disadvantaged minority populations less likely to evacuate than wealthier white residents. Finally, there are considerable discrepancies in terms of departure and return times by race and wealth, with strong social cohesion among evacuees from advantaged neighbourhoods in their destination choices. These empirical findings bring new insights into mobility and evacuations, providing policy recommendations for residents, decision-makers, and disaster managers alike.},

	title = {The {Death} and {Life} of {Great} {American} {Cities}},
	abstract = {This book is an attack on current methods of city planning and re-building. It is also an explanation of new principles and an argument for different methods from those now in use. It is the first real alternative to conventional city planning that we have had in this century. Its author, herself a city dweller and an editor of" Architectural Forum, is direct and practical in her approach. What, she asks, makes cities work? Why are some neighborhoods full of things to do and see and why are others dull? Why does the crime rate soar in our public housing developments and why are some of our older neighborhoods, despite their evident pov-erty, so much more safe, stable and congenial? Why do some neighborhoods attract interested and responsible populations and why do others degenerate? Why are Boston's North End and the eastern and western extremes of Greenwich Village good neighborhoods and why do orthodox city planners consider them slums? What alternatives are there to current city planning and rebuilding? Conventional city planning holds that cities decline because they are blighted by too many people, by mixtures of commercial, industrial and residential uses, by old buildings and narrow streets and by small landholders who stand in the way of large-scale development. Such neighborhoods, they insist, breed apathy and crime, discourage investment and contaminate the areas around them. The response of con-ventional city planning is to tear them down, scatter their inhabitants, lay out super-blocks, and rebuild the area accord-ing to an integrated plan, with the result, as often as not, that the crime rate rises still higher, the new neighborhood is more lifeless than the old one, and the surrounding areas deteriorate even more, until the life of the whole city is threatened. But Mrs. Jacobs observes that in any number of cases these very conditions--mixed uses, dense population, old buildings, small blocks, decentralized ownership--create the very opposite of slums, neighborhoods that regenerate themselves spontaneously, that are full of variety and diversity, that attract large numbers of casual visitors and responsible new residents, that encourage investment and revitalize the areas around them. Boston's North End (condemned as a slum by or-thodox planners) is such a neighborhood, and so is Greenwich Village. Rittenhouse Square and Telegraph Hill are others. Nearly every large city can produce still other examples. Why then do some city neighborhoods die and why do others flourish? And what can city planners do to avoid the death and encourage the life of our great American cities? The solutions proposed by Mrs. Jacobs in this book represent a sharp break with conventional thinking on the subject and they carry with them the ring of simple truth which marks this book as an inevitable classic of social thought. This edition is set from the first American edition of 1961 and commemorates the seventy-fifth anniversary of Random House.},

However, the city definition by which the urban boundary is determined is not comparable among different countries. A globally consistent delimitation of hierarchical urban boundaries (HUBs) is rare but urgently needed. In this research, we proposed a model to consistently identify HUBs according to physical urban entity. The main quantitative basis of our model is the density, size and spatial relationship of the artificial impervious surface. We produced a vector dataset of global HUBs (named GHUB) based on 30-meter resolution remote sensing products. Cross-product comparison shows the effectiveness and advantages of our model. We furtherly, for the first time, investigated and compared the physical form and spatial characteristics of global urban settlements through the same lens supported by GHUB. We have identified 10,242 urban settlements with an area above five square kilometers, 39.18\% of them are located within 100~km of the coastline. Urban settlements are not the {\textquotedblleft}reinforced concrete forest{\textquotedblright} as commonly thought. The global average proportion of open space within urban settlements is 41.51\%. The total area of urban open space in the world is 279.47 thousand square kilometers. Notably, we verified the Rank-size rule of urban settlement is universal, meanwhile, the verification results of different urban systems in 47 countries show that the Zipf{\textquoteright}s exponent varies from country to country. Our work can help to consistently investigate global urban settlements without being affected by various definitions of cities. The GHUB can not only be applied to various urban studies but also can support global affairs such as the Sustainable Development Goal 11 due to its international comparability.},

Previous studies demonstrated that population outflows from Wuhan determined COVID-19 cases in other cities but neglected spatial heterogeneities of their relationships. Here, we use Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model to investigate the spatially varying influences of outflows from Wuhan. Overall, the GWR model increases explanatory ability of outflows from Wuhan by 20\%, with the adjusted R2 increasing from 0.6 of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models to 0.8 of GWR models. The coefficient between logarithmic of outflows from Wuhan and COVID-19 cases in other cities is generally less than 1. The sub-linear scaling relationship indicates the increasing returns of outflows was restrained, proving the epidemic was efficiently controlled outside Hubei at the beginning without obvious local transmissions. Coefficients in GWR models vary in cities. Not only cities around Wuhan but also cities having close connections with Wuhan experienced higher coefficients, showing a higher vulnerability of these cities. The secondary or multi-level transmission networks deserve to be further explored to fully uncover influences of migrations on the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Although people may recognize urban vibrancy when they see or sense it, developing direct and comprehensive measures of urban vibrancy remains a challenge. In the context of intense global competition, there is an increased realization that urban vibrancy is vital to the social and economic sustainability of cities. Such vibrancy may be significantly shaped by the urban built environment, yet we know little about the close connections between vibrancy and urban built environments. Empowered by newly available sources of spatial big data, which provide enormous amounts of information on both human dynamics and the built environment, this paper proposes a framework for evaluating and characterizing urban vibrancy. Thus far, vibrancy measures have mostly used single-source data that hardly reflect the multifaceted manifestations of urban vibrancy. Therefore, we propose a more comprehensive measure of urban vibrancy, extracted as the common latent factor from multiple surface attributes. Using the proposed framework, we evaluated and mapped the spatial dynamics of vibrancy in Shanghai, a typical large city in post-reform China, and investigated the associations between vibrancy and various urban built environment indicators. The evidence shows that the horizontal built-up density, rather than vertical height, is the leading generator of vibrancy in Shanghai, followed by the density and mixture of urban functions, accessibility, and walkability. In this vein, we contribute to current debates and future planning practices regarding vibrant spaces in large cities. This proposed evaluation framework, equipped with spatial big data, can benefit future urban studies.},

We use multisource urban spatial information data, including real-time population distribution (RPD) data and small catering business (SCB) data; quantitatively measure urban vibrancy; and build a comparative framework to explore the effect of the built environment on the urban vibrancy of a northwestern emerging city in China. The results demonstrate that the two urban vibrancy metrics present a spatial distribution pattern that is high in the south and low in the north areas of the city with significant spatial aggregation. Land-use intensity and diversity have strong positive effects on urban vibrancy but present a different pattern of effects on the two vibrancy measures. The influences on urban vibrancy of distance to the district center and distance to the nearest commercial complex are spatially complementary in the study area, and the effect of accessibility factors is weak. Our findings suggest that a somewhat cautious approach is required in the application of these classical planning theories to Urumqi.},

In particular, we explore whether there are any differences in which urban features make an environment vibrant for different age groups. We perform this quantitative analysis by extracting urban features from OpenStreetMap and the Italian census, and using them in spatial models to describe urban vibrancy. Our analysis shows a strong relationship between urban features and urban vibrancy, and particularly highlights the importance of third places, which are urban places offering opportunities for social interactions. Our findings provide evidence that a combination of mobile phone data with crowdsourced urban features can be used to better understand urban vibrancy.},

	abstract = {The pervasiveness of mobile and sensing technologies today has facilitated the creation of Big Crowdsourced Geotagged Data (BCGD) from individual users in real time and at different locations in the city. Such ubiquitous user-generated data allow us to infer various patterns of human behavior, which helps us understand the interactions between humans and cities. In this article, we aim to analyze BCGD, including mobile consumption check-ins, urban geography data, and human mobility data, to learn a model that can unveil the impact of urban geography and human mobility on the vibrancy of residential communities. Vibrant communities are defined as places that show diverse and frequent consumer activities. To effectively identify such vibrant communities, we propose a supervised data mining system to learn and mimic the unique spatial configuration patterns and social interaction patterns of vibrant communities using urban geography and human mobility data. Specifically, to prepare the benchmark vibrancy scores of communities for training, we first propose a fused scoring method by fusing the frequency and the diversity of consumer activities using mobile check-in data. Besides, we define and extract the features of spatial configuration and social interaction for each community by mining urban geography and human mobility data. In addition, we strategically combine a pairwise ranking objective with a sparsity regularization to learn a predictor of community vibrancy. And we develop an effective solution for the optimization problem. Finally, our experiment is instantiated on BCGD including real estate, point of interests, taxi and bus GPS trajectories, and mobile check-ins in Beijing. The experimental results demonstrate the competitive performances of both the extracted features and the proposed model. Our results suggest that a structurally diverse community usually shows higher social interaction and better business performance, and incompatible land uses may decrease the vibrancy of a community. Our studies demonstrate the potential of how to best make use of BCGD to create local economic matrices and sustain urban vibrancy in a fast, cheap, and meaningful way.},

	abstract = {Urban vibrancy is defined and measured differently in the literature. Originally, it was described as the number of people in and around streets or neighborhoods. Now, it is commonly associated with activity intensity, the diversity of land-use configurations, and the accessibility of a place. The aim of this paper is to study urban vibrancy, its relationship with neighborhood services, and the real estate market. Firstly, it is used a set of neighborhood service variables, and a Principal Component Analysis is performed in order to create a Neighborhood Services Index (NeSI) that is able to identify the most and least vibrant urban areas of a city. Secondly, the influence of urban vibrancy on the listing prices of existing housing is analyzed by performing spatial analyses. To achieve this, the presence of spatial autocorrelation is investigated and spatial clusters are identified. Therefore, spatial autoregressive models are applied to manage spatial effects and to identify the variables that significantly influence the process of housing price determination. The results confirm that housing prices are spatially autocorrelated and highlight that housing prices and NeSI are statistically associated with each other. The identification of the urban areas characterized by different levels of vibrancy and housing prices can effectively support the revision of the urban development plan and its regulatory act, as well as strategic urban policies and actions. Such data analyses support a deep knowledge of the current status quo, which is necessary to drive important changes to develop more efficient, sustainable, and competitive cities.},

The development of spatial big data makes it possible to obtain information on user trajectories and the built environment, providing support for the evaluation of urban vibrancy. However, previous studies focused on the number of regional activities when evaluating urban vibrancy and ignored diversity, which was produced by diverse economic landscapes. In this paper, using mobile phone trajectory data, we propose a method for evaluating urban vibrancy from two dimensions: busyness and diversity, based on the improved PageRank algorithm and an index of entropy. Furthermore, in order to explore the relationship between urban vibrancy and the economic landscape, we construct an economic landscape index system based on multi-source data, including points of interest (POIs), roads, building footprints, house prices, the gross domestic product (GDP), and population data. Then, multiple linear regression is utilized to model the relationship between urban vibrancy and the urban economic landscape. The results show that combining busyness and diversity can better characterize urban vibrancy than any single indicator, and the adjusted R-squared (R2) of the regression with economic landscape reaches 0.59.},

We use fine-scale network mobility data in Ontario, Canada to study the association between three different mobility measures and four socio-economic indicators throughout the first and second wave of Covid-19 (January to December 2020). We find strong associations between mobility and the socio-economic indicators and that relationships between mobility and other socio-economic indicators vary over time. We further demonstrate that understanding how mobility has changed in response to Covid-19 varies considerably depending on how mobility is measured. Our findings have important implications for understanding how mobility data should be used to study interventions across space and time. Our results support that Covid-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions have resulted in geographically disparate responses to mobility and quantifying mobility changes at fine geographical scales is crucial to understanding the impacts of Covid-19.},

	abstract = {Agent-based models (ABMs) of urban systems have grown in popularity and complexity due to the widespread availability of high-performance computing resources and large data storage capabilities. Credible synthetic populations are crucial for the application of ABMs to understand urban phenomena. Although several (agent) population synthesis methods have been suggested over the years, the spatial dimension of synthetic populations has not received as much attention. This study addresses this myopic treatment of synthetic populations by creating two distinct components {\textendash} agents and the built environment {\textendash} that are integrated to form a {\textquoteleft}full{\textquoteright} spatially-detailed synthetic population. To generate agents, we used multiple Bayesian Networks (BN) to probabilistically draw pools from the microsample, followed by a Generalized Raking (GR) adjustment to match marginal controls. Using various measures, we demonstrate that our BN+GR framework outperforms more commonly used synthesis methods in both capturing the heterogeneity in the microsample and matching marginal controls. We also highlight the importance of accounting for heterogeneity by using separate type-specific models based on an explicitly defined household typology. For built environment synthesis, we generated various spatial entities such as buildings, housing units, establishments, and jobs at distinct spatial locations by fusing data from various spatial datasets. Their spatial distributions are found to effectively approximate the {\textquoteleft}real{\textquoteright} built environment in our study area. Our proposed framework can be used to generate a {\textquoteleft}full{\textquoteright} synthetic population for use in ABMs with more spatio-demographic heterogeneity than can otherwise be estimated using traditional methods.},

Our model demonstrates that both the time of initiating an intervention and its effectiveness had a very large impact on controlling the epidemic, and the current Chinese intense social distancing intervention has reduced the impact substantially but would have been even more effective had it started earlier.

	abstract = {Parking demand forecasting and behaviour analysis have received increasing attention in recent years because of their critical role in mitigating traffic congestion and understanding travel behaviours. However, previous studies usually only consider temporal dependence but ignore the spatial correlations among parking lots for parking prediction. This is mainly due to the lack of direct physical connections or observable interactions between them. Thus, how to quantify the spatial correlation remains a significant challenge. To bridge the gap, in this study, we propose a spatial-aware parking prediction framework, which includes two steps, i.e. spatial connection graph construction and spatio-temporal forecasting. A case study in Ningbo, China is conducted using parking data of over one million records before and during COVID-19. The results show that the approach is superior on parking occupancy forecasting than baseline methods, especially for the cases with high temporal irregularity such as during COVID-19. Our work has revealed the impact of the pandemic on parking behaviour and also accentuated the importance of modelling spatial dependence in parking behaviour forecasting, which can benefit future studies on epidemiology and human travel behaviours.},

	abstract = {A stay-at-home social distancing mandate is a key nonpharmacological measure to reduce the transmission rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), but a high rate of adherence is needed.To examine the association between the rate of human mobility changes and the rate of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.This cross-sectional study used daily travel distance and home dwell time derived from millions of anonymous mobile phone location data from March 11 to April 10, 2020, provided by the Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed in the 50 US states and District of Columbia and the association of mobility changes with rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.State-level stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.The main outcome was the association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The increase rates are measured by the exponent in curve fitting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases, while the mobility change (increase or decrease) rates were measured by the slope coefficient in curve fitting of median travel distance and median home dwell time for each state.Data from more than 45 million anonymous mobile phone devices were analyzed. The correlation between the COVID-19 increase rate and travel distance decrease rate was {\textendash}0.586 (95\% CI, {\textendash}0.742 to {\textendash}0.370) and the correlation between COVID-19 increase rate and home dwell time increase rate was 0.526 (95\% CI, 0.293 to 0.700). Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.0 to 6.9 days (median [interquartile range], 2.7 [2.3-3.3] days) before stay-at-home orders were enacted to 3.7 to 30.3 days (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [4.8-7.1] days) after stay-at-home social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with pandemic modeling results.These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. These results come at a particularly critical period when US states are beginning to relax social distancing policies and reopen their economies. These findings support the efficacy of social distancing and could help inform future implementation of social distancing policies should they need to be reinstated during later periods of COVID-19 reemergence.},

	abstract = {Due to the difficulty of tracking large numbers of new migrants, how their daily activity behaviors differ from those of settled residents has not been well investigated, leading to a lack of understanding of new migrants' integration. Meanwhile, existing research largely emphasized residential space and ignored other activity disparities. To obtain a more comprehensive picture of urban segregation, we identified new migrants and two settled urban groups from two kinds of human mobility data. A S-T-A-D-I interactive framework was proposed to measure segregation from multiple activity dimensions, including spatial colocation, temporal coexistence, accessibility, activity diversity, and social interaction. Two-scale analysis of spatial colocation patterns reveals residential segregation by both residential location and housing type, suggesting the effectiveness of the mobility data in profiling socioeconomic groups. The temporal disparity in undertaking activities was unveiled by identifying temporal coexistence patterns. Moreover, the groups presented significant inequality in accessibility owing to the use of different travel modes, leading to a notable disparity in activity diversity. Jointly determined by the disparities in space, time, and diversity, the three groups generated a high level of self-segregation, and new migrants and transit users presented very low interaction potentials with the car group.},

This letter presents an exploratory framework to examine the scale effect of fusing remote sensing and human sensing. The physical and social semantics are extracted from raw remote sensing images and human sensing data, respectively. A dynamic weighting strategy is developed to explore the fusion of remote sensing and human sensing. Taking urban function inference as an example, the scale effect is evaluated by weighting remote sensing and human sensing. The experiment demonstrates that fusing remote sensing and human sensing enables us to recognize multiple types of urban functions. Meanwhile, the results are significantly affected by the scale.},

	abstract = {Urban space and the behavior of human activities constantly interact with each other. Investigation on distribution of aggregated human activities and spatio-temporal change benefits data-driven policy-making in urban planning and urban governing. In the era of big data, with the development of information and communication technologies, it is possible to collect city-scale data with high resolution in space and time by various location-aware devices and sensors. Exploration of spatial-temporal activities attracts a lot of attention. By taking about 10 million one-day tracking data of mobile phone users in Shenzhen, China as an example, this paper firstly identified their stay locations according to spatial and temporal rules to generate stay trajectory for each individual and recovered activity semantic information by labelling activity types for each stay locations. Then, the significant differences in patterns of distributions of stay locations and their activities were analyzed. Spatial and temporal distributions of different human activities were explored, respectively. The study shows that the distribution of stay locations and activities is obviously heterogeneous. The average number of stay locations of an individual per day is 2.1, while the average number of activities an individual engaged in per day is 3.4. This study furthermore suggests that different types of activities have temporal variance and spatial heterogeneity. The temporal distribution fluctuates significantly over 24 hours, which is in accordance with daily routine. The spatial distribution overall obeys {\textquotedblleft}space power law{\textquotedblright}, and the spatial distribution of social activity, which has a faster-down tail, shows a more obvious pattern of spatial segregation than the other two activities. The study revealed the diversity and heterogeneity of spatial and temporal distribution of human aggregated activities in urban space, which is meaningful in analyzing human activities research and facilitating urban traffic optimization and urban planning.},

To address the issue, this paper applies data-driven behavioral analysis to identify functional areas for governments to construct urban design, offer site selection and manage transportation. Moreover, data-driven behavioral analysis can also be applied in student behaviors to help schools adjust facility arrangement, develop learning efficiency and provide high-quality services. Therefore, based on mobile phone data in Changchun, this paper utilizes a two-stage clustering method combining human mobility to identify urban functional areas, including business, working, residential and low passenger-flow areas. The interesting finding is that local prosperity in Changchun is prominent and the proportion of low passenger-flow areas can reflect the development level. Furthermore, this paper compares student behaviors in three schools, which shows each school varies in distribution features of students. Experiments provide enlightening insights to reveal the spatial structure of cities and comprehend the living state of students.},

However, these efforts have been limited mainly to a single source of disease. Also, they have not been tested on finer spatial scales. Based on prior work of effective distances on the country level, we propose the multiple-source effective distance, a metric that captures the distance for the virus to propagate through the mobility network on the county level in the U.S. Then, we estimate how the change in the number of sources impacts the global mobility rate. Based on the findings, a new method is proposed to locate sources and estimate the arrival time of the virus. The new metric outperforms the original single-source effective distance in predicting the arrival time. Last, we select two potential sources and quantify the arrival time delay caused by the national emergency declaration. In doing so, we provide quantitative answers on the effectiveness of the national emergency declaration.},

GWANN combines geographical weighting with artificial neural networks, which are able to learn complex nonlinear relationships in a data-driven manner without assumptions. Using synthetic data with known spatial characteristics and a real-world case study, we compared GWANN with GWR. While the results for the synthetic data show that GWANN performs better than GWR when the relationships within the data are nonlinear and their spatial variance is high, the results based on the real-world data demonstrate that the performance of GWANN can also be superior in a practical setting.},

As a result, movement metrics have widely been used by researchers and policy makers as indicators to study, model, and mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the veracity and variability of these mobility metrics have not been studied. This paper provides a systematic review of mobility and social distancing metrics available to researchers during the pandemic in 2020 in the United States. Twenty-six indices across nine different sources are analyzed and assessed with respect to their spatial and temporal coverage as well as sample representativeness at the county-level. Finally global and local indicators of spatial association are computed to explore spatial and temporal heterogeneity in mobility patterns. The structure of underlying changes in mobility and social distancing is examined in different US counties and across different data sets. We argue that a single measure might not describe all aspects of mobility perfectly.},

	abstract = {References to geographic locations are common in text data sources including social media and web pages. They take different forms from simple place names to relative expressions that describe location through a spatial relationship to a reference object (e.g. the house beside the Waikato River). Often complex, multi-word phrases are employed (e.g. the road and railway cross at right angles; the road in line with the canal) where spatial relationships are communicated with various parts of speech including prepositions, verbs, adverbs and adjectives. We address the problem of automatically detecting relative geospatial location descriptions, which we define as those that include spatial relation terms referencing geographic objects, and distinguishing them from non-geographical descriptions of location (e.g. the book on the table). We experiment with several methods for automated classification of text expressions, using features for machine learning that include bag of words that detect distinctive words, word embeddings that encode meanings of words and manually identified language patterns that characterise geospatial expressions. Using three data sets created for this study, we find that ensemble and meta-classifier approaches, that variously combine predictions from several other classifiers with data features, provide the best F-measure of 0.90 for detecting geospatial expressions.},

	abstract = {A common need for artificial intelligence models in the broader geoscience is to encode various types of spatial data, such as points, polylines, polygons, graphs, or rasters, in a hidden embedding space so that they can be readily incorporated into deep learning models. One fundamental step is to encode a single point location into an embedding space, such that this embedding is learning-friendly for downstream machine learning models. We call this process location encoding. However, there lacks a systematic review on location encoding, its potential applications, and key challenges that need to be addressed. This paper aims to fill this gap. We first provide a formal definition of location encoding, and discuss the necessity of it for GeoAI research. Next, we provide a comprehensive survey about the current landscape of location encoding research. We classify location encoding models into different categories based on their inputs and encoding methods, and compare them based on whether they are parametric, multi-scale, distance preserving, and direction aware. We demonstrate that existing location encoders can be unified under one formulation framework. We also discuss the application of location encoding. Finally, we point out several challenges that need to be solved in the future.},

	abstract = {We present a novel approach for estimating the proportional distributions of function types (i.e. functional distributions) in an urban area through learning semantics preserved embeddings of points-of-interest (POIs). Specifically, we represent POIs as low-dimensional vectors to capture (1) the spatial co-occurrence patterns of POIs and (2) the semantics conveyed by the POI hierarchical categories (i.e. categorical semantics). The proposed approach utilizes spatially explicit random walks in a POI network to learn spatial co-occurrence patterns, and a manifold learning algorithm to capture categorical semantics. The learned POI vector embeddings are then aggregated to generate regional embeddings with long short-term memory (LSTM) and attention mechanisms, to take account of the different levels of importance among the POIs in a region. Finally, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) maps regional embeddings to functional distributions. A case study in Xiamen Island, China implements and evaluates the proposed approach. The results indicate that our approach outperforms several competitive baseline models in all evaluation measures, and yields a relatively high consistency between the estimation and ground truth. In addition, a comprehensive error analysis unveils several intrinsic limitations of POI data for this task, e.g. ambiguous linkage between POIs and functions.},

	abstract = {Information extraction is a key activity for remote sensing images. A common distinction exists between knowledge-driven and data-driven methods. Knowledge-driven methods have advanced reasoning ability and interpretability, but have difficulty in handling complicated tasks since prior knowledge is usually limited when facing the highly complex spatial patterns and geoscience phenomena found in reality. Data-driven models, especially those emerging in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have achieved substantial progress in geoscience and remote sensing applications. Although DL models have powerful feature learning and representation capabilities, traditional DL has inherent problems including working as a black box and generally requiring a large number of labeled training data. The focus of this paper is on methods that integrate domain knowledge, such as geoscience knowledge and geoscience features (GK/GFs), into the design of DL models. The paper introduces the new paradigm of geoscience-aware deep learning (GADL), in which GK/GFs and DL models are combined deeply to extract information from remote sensing data. It first provides a comprehensive summary of GK/GFs used in GADL, which forms the basis for subsequent integration of GK/GFs with DL models. This is followed by a taxonomy of approaches for integrating GK/GFs with DL models. Several approaches are detailed using illustrative examples. Challenges and research prospects in GADL are then discussed. Developing more novel and advanced methods in GADL is expected to become the prevailing trend in advancing remotely sensed information extraction in the future.},

	abstract = {The quest for a theory of cities that could offer a quantitative and systematic approach to manage cities is at the top priority, given the challenges humanity faces due to the increasing urbanization and densification of cities. If such a theory is feasible, then its formulation must be in a mathematical way. As a contribution to organizing the mathematical ideas that deal with such a systematic way of understanding urban phenomena, we present this material, concentrating on one important aspect of what recently has been called the new science of cities. In this paper, we review the main mathematical models present in the literature that aim at explaining the origin and emergence of urban scaling. We intend to present the models, identify similarities and connections between them, and find situations in which different models lead to the same output. In addition, we report situations in which some ideas initially introduced in a particular model can also be introduced in another model, generating more diversification and increasing the scope of the models. The models treated in this paper explain urban scaling from different premises: from gravity ideas, passing through densification ideas and cites' geometry, to a hierarchical organization and socio-network properties. We also investigate scenarios in which these different fundamental ideas could be interpreted as similar -- where the similarity is likely but not obvious. Furthermore, in what concerns the gravity idea, we propose a general framework that includes all gravity models analyzed as a particular case.},

	abstract = {Urban growth has been increasing rapidly across the globe, in particular in low and middle-income developing countries. As city populations and GDP per capita rise exponentially, cities tend to experience similar challenges related to urban development and transport/mobility. One of the most problematic issues emerges when urban growth drives car-oriented urban development. This is characterised by a range of unsustainable patterns such as low-density development, urban sprawl, lack of plans and infrastructure to accommodate collective transport and active travel, and significant efforts and investments to meet the demand for private motorised vehicle use. For emergent cities, the risk is that these developments lead to highly inefficient, unhealthy and unsustainable urban systems that are difficult to remedy. This paper aims to identify recurrent governance and policy factors across sectors, as well as macro factors, that tend to contribute to car-dependent urban mobility systems in rapidly growing cities. It draws on qualitative and quantitative research findings from five under-researched Eastern European and Middle Eastern cities: Tallinn, Bucharest, Skopje, Adana and Amman. Data examining the evolution of urban mobility in these cities were collected as part of the Horizon2020 EU funded project CREATE. The paper investigates the extent to which car-dependent urban development processes can be avoided in rapidly growing cities, to support transitions towards liveable and sustainable cities. Finally, it provides policy recommendations targeting growing cities with low levels of car-use, in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa. It highlights the importance of acting swiftly to achieve targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals, the New Urban Agenda or the Paris Agreement, by supporting policies fostering efficient, sustainable and inclusive urban mobility and land-use across sectors and levels of governance.},

Here we present a large scale investigation about the connection between these two laws using population and GDP data from almost five thousand consistently-defined cities in 96 countries. We empirically demonstrate that both laws are tied to each other and derive an expression relating the urban scaling and Zipf exponents. This expression captures the average tendency of the empirical relation between both exponents, and simulations yield very similar results to the real data after accounting for random variations. We find that while the vast majority of countries exhibit increasing returns to scale of urban GDP, this effect is less pronounced in countries with fewer small cities and more metropolises (small Zipf exponent) than in countries with a more uneven number of small and large cities (large Zipf exponent). Our research puts forward the idea that urban scaling does not solely emerge from intra-city processes, as population distribution and scaling of urban GDP are correlated to each other.},

Three major elements of urban development are considered: construction materials for infrastructure (including residential dwellings, utilities, and roads), building operations, and transportation (private automobiles and public transit). Two case studies from the City of Toronto are analyzed. An economic input{\textendash}output life-cycle assessment (EIO-LCA) model is applied to estimate the energy use and GHG emissions associated with the manufacture of construction materials for infrastructure. Operational requirements for dwellings and transportation are estimated using nationally and/or regionally averaged data. The results indicate that the most targeted measures to reduce GHG emissions in an urban development context should be aimed at transportation emissions, while the most targeted measures to reduce energy usage should focus on building operations. The results also show that low-density suburban development is more energy and GHG intensive (by a factor of 2.0{\textendash}2.5) than high-density urban core development on a per capita basis. When the functional unit is changed to a per unit of living space basis the factor decreases to 1.0{\textendash}1.5, illustrating that the choice of functional unit is highly relevant to a full understanding of urban density effects.},

	abstract = {Global sustainability relies on our capacity of understanding and guiding urban systems, and their metabolism, in an adequate way. It has been proposed that bigger and denser cities are more resource-efficient than smaller ones because they tend to demand less infrastructure, consume less fuel for transportation and less energy for cooling or heating in per capita terms. This hypothesis is also called Brand's Law. But as cities get bigger, denser and more resource-efficient they also get richer. And richer inhabitants buy more, increasing its resource demand and associated environmental impacts. To fully understand the nexus between population size or density and the environmental impacts generated by a city, one needs to take into account both direct and indirect impacts. Facing the lack of empirical evidence on consumption-based emissions for cities, in this paper we propose a mean-field model to derive emissions estimations out of well-established urban metrics (city size, density, infrastructure, wealth). We aim at understanding if Brand's law holds true after adopting a consumption-based approach to urban emissions. The proposed model shows that when considering consumption-based emissions, in most cases Brand's law falls apart - bigger cities have greater purchase power, resulting in greater consumption of goods and higher associated GHG emissions. The model also shows that decoupling between population and emissions is possible and dependent on the decoupling level between income and impacts. In order to achieve it, a shift in consumption patterns of most cities is of utmost importance, so that each new monetary unit added to the GDP, or any other income variable for that effect does not result in a proportional increase in GHG emissions.},

This hypothesis is also called Brand{\textquoteright}s Law. However, as cities get bigger, denser and more resource-efficient, they also get richer, and richer inhabitants consume more, potentially increasing resource demand and associated environmental impacts. In this paper, we propose a method based on scaling theory to assess Brand{\textquoteright}s Law taking into account greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both direct (energy and fuels locally consumed) and indirect (embedded in goods and services) sources, measured as carbon footprint (CF). We aim at understanding whether Brand{\textquoteright}s Law can be confirmed once we adopt a consumption-based approach to urban emissions. By analyzing the balance between direct and indirect emissions in a theoretical urban system, we develop a scaling theory relating carbon footprint and city size. Facing the lack of empirical data on consumption-based emissions for cities, we developed a model to derive emission estimations using well-established urban metrics (city size, density, infrastructure, wealth). Our results show that, once consumption-based CF is considered, Brand{\textquoteright}s Law falls apart, as bigger cities have greater purchase power, leading to greater consumption of goods and higher associated GHG. Findings also suggest that a shift in consumption patterns is of utmost importance, given that, according to the model, each new monetary unit added to the gross domestic product (GDP) or to other income variables results in a more than proportional increase in GHG emissions. This work contributes to a broader assessment of the causes of emissions and the paradigm shift regarding the assumption of efficiency in the relationship of city size and emissions, adding consumption behavior as a critical variable, beyond Brand{\textquoteright}s Law.},

	abstract = {Medieval European urbanization presents a line of continuity between earlier cities and modern European urban systems. Yet, many of the spatial, political and economic features of medieval European cities were particular to the Middle Ages, and subsequently changed over the Early Modern Period and Industrial Revolution. There is a long tradition of demographic studies estimating the population sizes of medieval European cities, and comparative analyses of these data have shed much light on the long-term evolution of urban systems. However, the next step{\textemdash}to systematically relate the population size of these cities to their spatial and socioeconomic characteristics{\textemdash}has seldom been taken. This raises a series of interesting questions, as both modern and ancient cities have been observed to obey area-population relationships predicted by settlement scaling theory. To address these questions, we analyze a new dataset for the settled area and population of 173 European cities from the early fourteenth century to determine the relationship between population and settled area. To interpret this data, we develop two related models that lead to differing predictions regarding the quantitative form of the population-area relationship, depending on the level of social mixing present in these cities. Our empirical estimates of model parameters show a strong densification of cities with city population size, consistent with patterns in contemporary cities. Although social life in medieval Europe was orchestrated by hierarchical institutions (e.g., guilds, church, municipal organizations), our results show no statistically significant influence of these institutions on agglomeration effects. The similarities between the empirical patterns of settlement relating area to population observed here support the hypothesis that cities throughout history share common principles of organization that self-consistently relate their socioeconomic networks to structured urban spaces.},

We then analyze the structure of economic change in Chinese cities using a variety of metrics, characterizing employment, firms and households. Population size estimates remain a major challenge for Chinese cities, as official numbers are often reported based on the Hukou registration system. We use the information in the residuals to scaling relations for economic quantities to predict actual resident population and show that these estimates agree well with data for a subset of cities for which counts of total resident population exist.

We use data of urban agglomerations in India from the Census 2011 and from a few other sources to characterize patterns of urban population density, infrastructure, urban services, crime and technological innovation. Many of the results are in line with expectations from urban theory and with the behaviour of analogous quantities in other urban systems in both high and middle-income nations. India is a continental scale, fast developing urban system, and consequently there are also a number of interesting exceptions and surprises related to both particular quantities and strong regional patterns of variation. Specifically, these relate to the potential salience of gender and caste in driving sub-linear scaling of crime and to the geography of technological innovation. We characterize these patterns in detail for crime and invention, and connect them to the existing literature on their determinants in a specifically Indian context. The paucity of data at the urban level and the absence of official definitions for functional cities in India create a number of limitations and caveats to any present analysis. We discuss these shortcomings and spell out the challenge for a systematic statistical data collection relevant to cities and urban development in India.},

Using new harmonized definitions for functional urban areas, we examine to what extent these ideas apply to European cities. We show that while most large urban systems in Western Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK) approximately agree with theoretical expectations, the small number of cities in each nation and their natural variability preclude drawing strong conclusions. We demonstrate how this problem can be overcome so that cities from different urban systems can be pooled together to construct larger datasets. This leads to a simple statistical procedure to identify urban scaling relations, which then clearly emerge as a property of European cities. We compare the predictions of urban scaling to Zipf's law for the size distribution of cities and show that while the former holds well the latter is a poor descriptor of European cities. We conclude with scenarios for the size and properties of future pan-European megacities and their implications for the economic productivity, technological sophistication and regional inequalities of an integrated European urban system.},

A healthy debate exists on what constitutes optimal structure regarding livability in cities, interpolating, for instance, between mono- and poly-centric organization. Here anonymous and aggregated flows generated from three hundred million users, opted-in to Location History, are used to extract global Intra-urban trips. We develop a metric that allows us to classify cities and to establish a connection between mobility organization and key urban indicators. We demonstrate that cities with strong hierarchical mobility structure display an extensive use of public transport, higher levels of walkability, lower pollutant emissions per capita and better health indicators. Our framework outperforms previous metrics, is highly scalable and can be deployed with little cost, even in areas without resources for traditional data collection.},

	abstract = {Transportation networks, from bicycle paths to buses and railways, are the backbone of urban mobility. In large metropolitan areas, the integration of different transport modes has become crucial to guarantee the fast and sustainable flow of people. Using a network science approach, multimodal transport systems can be described as multilayer networks, where the networks associated to different transport modes are not considered in isolation, but as a set of interconnected layers. Despite the importance of multimodality in modern cities, a unified view of the topic is currently missing. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the emerging research areas of multilayer transport networks and multimodal urban mobility, focusing on contributions from the interdisciplinary fields of complex systems, urban data science, and science of cities. First, we present an introduction to the mathematical framework of multilayer networks. We apply it to survey models of multimodal infrastructures, as well as measures used for quantifying multimodality, and related empirical findings. We review modeling approaches and observational evidence in multimodal mobility and public transport system dynamics, focusing on integrated real-world mobility patterns, where individuals navigate urban systems using different transport modes. We then provide a survey of freely available datasets on multimodal infrastructure and mobility, and a list of open-source tools for their analyses. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on open research questions and promising directions for future research.},

Representing the various urban transport networks is crucial in understanding travel behavior and the function of the transport system. However, previous studies have ignored the coupling relationships between multi-mode transport networks and travel flows. To address this problem, we constructed a multilayer network to illustrate two modes of transport (bus and metro) by assigning weights of travel flow and efficiency. We explored the scaling of the public transport system to validate the multilayer network and offered new visions for transportation improvements by considering population. The proposed methodology was demonstrated by using public transport datasets of Shanghai, China. For both the bus network and multilayer network, the scaling of node degree versus Population were explored at 1 km * 1 km urban cells. The results suggested that in the multilayer network, the scaling relations between node degree and population can provide valuable insights into quantifying the integration between the public transport system and urban land use, which will benefit sustainable improvements to cities.},

	abstract = {Vibrancy is one of the most desirable outcomes of transit-oriented development (TOD). The vibrancy of a metro station area (MSA) depends partially on the MSA{\textquoteright}s built-environment features. Predicting an MSA{\textquoteright}s vibrancy with its built-environment features is of great interest to decision makers as these features are often modifiable by public interventions. However, little has been done on MSAs{\textquoteright} vibrancy in existing studies. On the one hand, seldom has the vibrancy of MSAs been explicitly explored, and measuring the vibrancy is essential. On the other hand, because MSAs are interconnected, one MSA{\textquoteright}s vibrancy depends on the MSA{\textquoteright}s features and those of relevant MSAs. Hence, selecting a suitable metric that quantifies spatial relationships between MSAs can better predict MSAs{\textquoteright} vibrancy. In this study, we identify four single-dimensional vibrancy proxies and fuse them into an integrated index. Moreover, we design a two-layer graph convolutional neural network model that accounts for both the built-environment features of MSAs and spatial relationships between MSAs. We employ the model in an empirical study in Shenzhen, China, and illustrate (1) how different metrics of spatial relationships influence the prediction of MSAs{\textquoteright} vibrancy; (2) how the predictability varies across single-dimensional and integrated proxies of MSAs{\textquoteright} vibrancy; and (3) how the findings of this study can be used to enlighten decision makers. This study enriches our understandings of spatial relationships between MSAs. Moreover, it can help decision makers with targeted policies for developing MSAs towards TOD.},

            Metro is being~developed rapidly in second-tier cities. There is a need to understand the impact it brings as it relates to the planning and management of the whole urban transportation system. In this paper, we applied the multilayer complex network theory to study this problem by contrasting the characteristics of transportation networks before and after the metro is built. We focused on transportation networks in second-tier cities and (1) proposed edge functions of the road subnetwork and rail transit subnetwork with impedance as weight; (2) established an interlayer function based on the transfer behavior to couple the above subnetworks into the multilayer weighted transportation network; and (3) redefined statistical parameters, such as node strength, chessboard coefficient, and average least pass cost. At last, Hohhot, China, a typical second-tier city, was taken as a case study. Calculations show that the new-built metro network in the second-tier city increases convenience and reduces travel cost, whereas, the vulnerability of the whole network increases, and the distribution of key nodes in the road network is reconstructed. For the sustainable development of urban transportation, more attention should be paid to the new-built metro in second-tier cities.},

Knowing the dynamic semantics of urban spaces, which are implied in spatiotemporal patterns of human activities, can help urban planners and managers understand how a city performs over time and space. The very large amount of multidimensional user-generated data makes it possible to disclose the spatiotemporal patterns of human activities from multiple perspectives. In this paper, using Beijing as a case study, we extract the dynamic semantics of urban spaces through the spatiotemporal patterns of human activities discovered from crowdsourced positioning data. A high-order decomposition method, tensor factorization, is used to explore the crowdsourced positioning data. The decomposition results reveal five hourly patterns, four daily patterns and six spatial patterns of urban dynamics in Beijing, showing that urban dynamics in Beijing vary noticeably over different hours, days and space. The human activities implicated by hourly and daily patterns are inferred through empirical knowledge, and the activity semantics of spatial patterns are further disclosed by using the interaction relations among three dimensions stored in the core tensor. The k-means clustering method is executed to aggregate similar spatial units into one group. Five clusters of regions with similar activity semantics are discovered, the function semantics of clusters are clarified with point of interest (POI) data.},

Characterizing and comparing various street networks could then be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of these systems. Their characterization is however not easy: there are no simple tools to classify planar networks and most of the measures developed for complex networks are not useful when space is relevant. Here, we describe recent efforts in this direction and new methods adapted to spatial networks. We will first discuss measures based on the structure of shortest paths, among which the betweenness centrality. In particular for time-evolving road networks, we will show that the spatial distribution of the betweenness centrality is able to reveal the impact of important structural transformations. Shortest paths are however not the only relevant ones. In particular, they can be very different from those with the smallest number of turns{\textemdash}the simplest paths. The statistical comparison of the lengths of the shortest and simplest paths provides a nontrivial and nonlocal information about the spatial organization of planar graphs. We define the simplicity index as the average ratio of these lengths and the simplicity profile characterizes the simplicity at different scales. Measuring these quantities on artificial (roads, highways, railways) and natural networks (leaves, insect wings) show that there are fundamental differences{\textemdash}probably related to their different function{\textemdash}in the organization of urban and biological systems: there is a clear hierarchy of the lengths of straight lines in biological cases, but they are randomly distributed in urban systems. The paths are however not enough to fully characterize the spatial pattern of planar networks such as streets and roads. Another promising direction is to analyze the statistics of blocks of the planar network. More precisely, we can use the conditional probability distribution of the shape factor of blocks with a given area, and define what could constitute the fingerprint of a city. These fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a classification of cities based on their street patterns. This method applied on more than 130 cities in the world leads to four broad families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. This classification will be helpful for identifying dominant mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of street patterns.},

	abstract = {A location's irreplaceability refers to the degree of difficulty with which it can be replaced by other locations. For example, the irreplaceability of airports, hospitals, and ATMs varies, and that between hospitals is also different. They differ in both the number of users and the extent of service area. Quantifying the location's irreplaceability provides guidance for urban planning, such as siting of public resources. Existing methods for quantifying an urban location's irreplaceability do not consider human activity at the location, therefore the revealed irre- placeability may deviate from the resident's perceptions. To address this issue, we use origin-destination flows to reflect human activity. We propose a flow-based locational measure, I-index, to quantify the location's irre- placeability. It can be viewed as {\textquoteleft}H-index of flow{\textquoteright} where we regard locations as scientists, flows as papers. I-index of a location is the maximum value of i such that at least i flows with a length of at least $\alpha$ * i meters have reached this location, where $\alpha$ is the conversion factor that can be determined adaptively from the flow dataset. I-index elegantly combines the flow volume and length into a single value. The effectiveness of the I-index is validated by simulation experiments. Two case studies show that the hospital's irreplaceability strongly correlates with the hospital bypass behavior and locations with strongly mixed urban functions are more irreplaceable. The im- plications for urban planning are further discussed.},

Thus, to quantify the occurrence probabilities of all the daily activities as well as their sequential orders, we develop a novel process to build multiple alignments of the sequences and subsequently derive profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs). This process consists of 4 major steps. First, activity sequences are clustered based on a pre-defined scheme. The frequent activities along with their sequential orders are then identified in each cluster, and they are subsequently used as a template to guide the construction of a multiple alignment of the cluster of sequences. Finally, a pHMM is employed to convert the multiple alignment into a position-specific scoring system, representing the probability of each frequent activity at each important position of the alignment as well as the probabilities of both insertion and deletion of infrequent activities.},

These observed trends are deeply rooted in the spatial patterns of society, and require geographical extensions in network models of social influence. improved understanding of the ways in which new technologies and new ideas diffuse across locations can provide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological progress and economic development. In this work, we uncover the role of geography in the spatial diffusion of innovations via a unique dataset from iWiW, which is an online social network (OSN) in Hungary. We analyze its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, reaching up to 300 million friendships at the peak of its popularity and the subsequent disappearance after its failed competition with international OSN platforms. By applying a complex diffusion model on the empirical spatial social network, we observe that the connections of individuals with similar tendency to adopt, or assortative mixing, is crucial in spatial spreading. However, predicting the likelihood of adoption is the aim of diffusion models and a priori labeling of individuals in these models would be a paradox. Alternatively, we reveal the scaling laws in the number of innovators and early adopters in towns as a function of their population and gravity laws on the distance of ties. These empirical features need to be included in models of complex contagion.},

Space analysis focuses on a users location, and time analysis emphasises a users mobility on a daily basis. From the raw positioning data of various sets of user mobility, we analysed a personal human mobility model. Each users positioning data set is pre-processed and clustered by space and time. For spatial clustering, we developed a mechanism of clustering with expectation maximisation methodology. For temporal clustering, stay or transition probabilities over a 24 hour period were analysed. We represented the result of the personal human mobility model using the continuoustime Markov chain (CTMC) with spatial transition probabilities over time.

Spatial location is the key factor affecting individual activity space measurements, and the impacts of the separation effects of residence and workplace may deserve attention, especially in the areas with a single urban spatial structure or urban function.

This paper presents our prelmi inary investigation on this subject, including its framework,major acquisitionmethods, and sample applications. The basic concept of spatial intelligence derived from psychology refers to themental process associated with the brain{\textquoteright}s attempts to interpret certain types of information received. This{\textbackslash}ninformation basically includes anykind ofmental input, such asvisualpictures, maps, and plans. Based on this concept,we propose that the introduction of spatial intelligencewithin the domain of GIS cience is an ability to discover and apply spatial patterns, which is usually elicited through analysis/mining, optmi ization, and smi ulation. Two characteristics of spatial intelligence are highlighted here. One is the ability of spatial cognition, and the other is the self learning capability. Spatialcognition refers to the processofrecognizing, encoding, saving, expressing, decomposing, constructing and generalizing spatialobjects, which can be obtained from spatialobservation, spatial perception, spatial indexing, and spatial deductive inference. Self learning includes enforcing learning, adaptive learning, and knowledge acquiring abilities to actively dig up knowledge from observation data. Promoting spatial intelligence is a logical requirement forhigher level analysis and application ofGIScience. Through active learning and searching process in complex spatiotemporal data,spatial intelligence discovers unknown spatial patterns, trends, and regularities.From the technical perspective, we emphasize the use ofmeta-heuristic and other intelligent algorithms to address complex geospatial problems. A three-tiered structure is proposed for the spatial intelligence framework. At the bottom of the framework, spatial statistics,programming, and intelligence computation are used to provide the foundation of spatial analysis, smi ulation, and optmi ization. The middle level consists of spatial intelligence, self learning, and spatial cognition foranalyzing, smi ulating, interpreting, and decisionmaking forgeospatialprocesses and phenomena. At the top of the framework, GIScience laws and regularities are used to mine unknown patterns. To realize the goal of spatial intelligence, a solid research that integrates key topics with the concepts and modeling approaches derived from Information Science andOperationsResearch to advanceGIS theories have been developed. The core supportingmethods and techniques pertinent to the proposed framework include spatial analysis, smi ulation, and optmi ization. The development of spatial analyticalmodels to represent spatial and temporal features and their relationships forms a vital aspectof this research. Spatial optmi ization is employed tomaxmi ize orminmi ize a planning objective, given the lmi ited area, finite resources, and spatial relationships for a location-specific problem,once spatiotemporal patterns have been discovered. Smi ulation is an mi portant tool to evaluate and mi provemodels and spatial patterns.Some successfulapplicationsofspatialanalysis, optmi ization, and smi ulation are also reported in thispaper. Logistic regression models,e.g.,binomia,l multinomia,l and Nested Logit,are applied and examined to predict various spatiotemporal changes, including rural to commercia,l rural to recreationa,l and rural to other land uses.A range of heuristic algorithms, such as Geneti Algorithms (GA) and Ant Colony Systems (Ant), to troubleshoot complex routing and location problems,andmulti-objective optmi ization forspatialdecisionmaking are studied.A case study of integrating agent-basedmodelingwith analyticalmodelsby drawing uponmicroscopic traffic smi ulations for emulating real-tmi e traffic conditions is also conducted.},

It can well reflect the working and living conditions of the population and is a source for studying urban life. Based on the takeout data in the city of Hangzhou, China, this study uses the customers' detailed order information to extract three dietary taste patterns: spicy, sweet, and light. We then combine the dietary taste patterns with points of interest and land use data to identify the location attributes of order destination and explore the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of dietary taste patterns. The results show differences in dietary behavior of people at the community scale, and help us understand the local culture and socio-demographic characteristics from the perspective of diet. Dietary taste pattern is closely related to timing and location, which reflects differences in consumption tendencies, and socio-demographic heterogeneity. This research helps to present the dietary characteristics of different population groups and their spatial distribution, and supplements the content of urban research on foodscape.},

In this survey, we review the rapidly growing body of research using different graph neural networks, e.g. graph convolutional and graph attention networks, in various traffic forecasting problems, e.g. road traffic flow and speed forecasting, passenger flow forecasting in urban rail transit systems, and demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms. We also present a comprehensive list of open data and source resources for each problem and identify future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first comprehensive survey that explores the application of graph neural networks for traffic forecasting problems.

Using mobile phone data, this study aims to recognize citywide land use classes in a highly accurate and timely manner, because land use classes are important for urban planning and urban management. How to extract key and discriminative features from mobile-phone-call time series is an essential problem for urban land-use classification. Considering the high dimensional characteristic of mobile-phone-call time series data, an improved land-use classification framework with deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) is proposed to automatically recognize land-use types in urban areas, which are geographical regions clustered based on the similarity of features in waveform and magnitude of mobile-phone-call time series. The method is validated using mobile phone data collected in Wuhan city, China. The experimental result shows that the key and discriminative features in waveform and magnitude can be extracted without human prior knowledge and these features extracted by DCAE can improve the performance to distinguish functionally similar land-use types, such as business and industrial/commercial types.},

	abstract = {Investigating the macroscopic mobility laws of the population and the microscopic travel characteristics of individuals in a city offers an essential way of understanding the city as a complex system. Research that combines the travel laws of the population and individuals simultaneously poses a challenging and complicated task. In this paper, a 4-dimensional tensor is created to describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of people{\textquoteright}s various mobility motifs. Non-negative tensor decomposition is used to identify the principal patterns of time, space, and daily motifs in a city and the level of interactions between them. Moreover, the major network indicators of the human mobility networks constructed in terms of three principal motif patterns are statistically analyzed and calculated from the complex network perspective. Relying on a conjoint analysis of core tensor and network indicators, we find that the three motif patterns correspond to three real-life mobility scenarios: simple motifs dominated by commuting, complex motifs based on more complicated life and entertainment activities, and single trips departing from or arriving at airports or railway stations, respectively. Furthermore, the intra-city mobility networks constituted by the three motif patterns differ significantly in network heterogeneity, node importance, entropy, and clustering coefficient. This suggests that the existing studies on intra-city human mobility networks that only consider first-order trips may be the average results of aggregations containing many people with different characteristics. In our work, the specific research on the spatiotemporal characteristics of people with different mobility motif patterns can assist policy makers in conducting fine-scale management and implementing specific policies.},

Since the Reform and Opening up of China in 1983, the PRD has been growing from several isolated cities to one megacity region. Uncovering spatial characteristics is essential for the megacity region synergy, regional planning, and governance. Massive mobile phone location data contains hidden information of complex spatial networks. From the flow perspective, this study thereafter constructs a large-scale mobility network using long-period mobile phone location data. The Louvain method is adopted to detect spatial communities, which reveals the spatial cooperation within the detected area. The disparity filter is used to extract the backbone network, which unravels the geographical connection among these areas. An experiment in the PRD was conducted to investigate the spatial synergy in the PRD. The results suggest that the PRD is with a significant trend of spatial synergy; the backbone of mobility network demonstrates that Guangzhou and Shenzhen are the spatial cores; the East-West differences do exist, the closer to the central urban areas, the higher the degrees of spatial integration. These results will benefit the synergic spatial planning and governance of the PRD.},

For example, the level of economic development and the structure of population are important statistics for regional or national policy-making. However, the collection of these characteristics usually depends on demographic and social surveys, which are time- and labor-intensive. To address these issues, we propose a machine learning-based approach to estimate and map the economic development from multi-source open available geospatial data, including remote sensing imagery and OpenStreetMap road networks. Specifically, we first extract knowledge-based features from different data sources; then the multi-view graphs are constructed through different perspectives of spatial adjacency and feature similarity; and a multi-view graph neural network (MVGNN) model is built on them and trained in a self-supervised learning manner. Then, the handcrafted features and the learned graph representations are combined to estimate the regional economic development indicators via random forest models. Taking China{\textquoteright}s county-level gross domestic product (GDP) as an example, extensive experiments have been conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the combination of the knowledge-based and learning-based features can significantly outperform baseline methods. Our proposed approach can advance the goal of acquiring timely and accurate socioeconomic variables through widely accessible geospatial data, which has the potential to extend to more social indicators and other geographic regions to support smart governance and policy-making in the future.},

However, it is unclear whether the existing administrative subdivisions reflect the most plausible spatial structure for the daily movements of FFBS users. In this study, we first build a spatial interaction network based on FFBS journey data from Nanjing, China. On this basis, urban activity zones are delineated leveraging the Leiden community detection algorithm, and a set of network measures are then utilized to examine the properties of these activity zones. The community detection results show that the identified activity zone borders rarely overlap with existing administrative district borders. Activity zone borders could separate FFBS travel flows more rationally than administrative district borders. In order to quantitatively explore the attenuation effect of activity zone borders on FFBS travel flows, we further subdivide the borders into various types (i.e., administrative, natural, and infrastructural borders) and construct border effect models. The regression results show that, in addition to demographic size, built environment, and distance factors, the activity zone border parameters are also revealed as important predictors of bilateral travel flows. Among the different types of activity zone borders, natural borders consisting of water bodies and mountains have the most significant attenuation effect on FFBS travel flows. The delineation of activity zones could better portray short-distance mobility patterns and urban structures, thereby providing nuanced and appropriate guidance for deliberating related policies.},

First, we examine the spatiotemporal patterns of turning traffic flow. Then, an end-to-end deep learning structure with four components is designed to model turning traffic flow. In our model, graph convolutional network is revised to learn spatial dependencies and sparseness, and gate recurrent unit network with an attention mechanism is developed to learn temporal dependencies and fluctuations. Experiments were conducted in Wuhan, China, where taxicab trajectory data were used to train and validate our model.

	abstract = {The accurate and robust prediction of vessel traffic flow is gaining importance in maritime intelligent transportation system (ITS), such as vessel traffic services, maritime spatial planning, and traffic safety management, etc. To achieve fine-grained vessel traffic flow prediction, we will first generate the maritime traffic network (which is essentially a graph), and then propose a graph-driven neural network. In particular, to represent various correlations among spatio-temporal vessel traffic flow, we tend to extract the feature points (i.e., starting, way and ending points) by utilizing the knowledge of vessel positioning data. These feature points are essentially related to the geometrical structures of massive vessel trajectories collected from massive automatic identification system (AIS) records, contributing to the generation of maritime traffic network. We then propose a spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network (STMGCN)-based vessel traffic flow prediction method by exploiting multiple types of inherent correlations in the generated maritime graph. The proposed STMGCN mainly contains one spatial multi-graph convolutional layer and two temporal gated convolutional layers, beneficial for extracting spatial and temporal traffic flow patterns. The main benefit of our graph-driven prediction method is that it takes full advantage of the maritime graph and multi-graph learning. Comprehensive experiments have been implemented on realistic AIS dataset to compare our method with several state-of-the-art prediction methods. The fine-grained prediction results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both accuracy and robustness.},

With the rise of GeoAI research, many high-quality urban observation datasets and deep learning models have emerged. However, geospatial heterogeneity makes these resources challenging to share and migrate to new application scenarios. This paper introduces vision language and semantic pre-trained model for street view image analysis as an example. This bridges the boundaries of data formats under location coupling, allowing for the acquisition of text-image urban scene objective descriptions in the physical space from the human perspective, including entities, entity attributes, and the relationships between entities. Besides, we proposed the SFT-BERT model to extract text feature sets of 10 urban land use categories from 8,923 scenes in Wuhan. The results show that our method outperforms seven baseline models, including computer vision, and improves 15\% compared to traditional deep learning methods, demonstrating the potential of a pre-train \& fine-tune paradigm for GIS spatial analysis. Our model could also be reused in other cities, and more accurate image descriptions and scene judgments could be obtained by inputting street view images from different angles.

	abstract = {Predicting Origin-Destination (OD) flow is a crucial problem for intelligent transportation. However, it is extremely challenging because of three reasons: first, correlations exist between both origins and destinations; second, the correlations are dynamic across the time; at last, there are multiple correlations from different aspects. To the best of our knowledge, existing models for OD flow prediction cannot tackle all of these three issues simultaneously. We propose Multi-Perspective Graph Convolutional Networks (MPGCN) to capture the complex dependencies. Our proposed model first utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) network to extract temporal features for each OD pair and then learns the spatial dependency of origins and destinations by a two-dimensional graph convolutional network. Furthermore, we design a dynamic graph together with two static graphs to capture the complicated spatial dependencies and use an average strategy to obtain the final predicted OD flow. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale and real-world datasets, which not only demonstrate our design philosophy but also validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Activity space segregation research is an emerging field, characterized by quick adaptation of novel data sources and interdisciplinary methodologies. In this article, we present a methodological review of activity space segregation research by identifying approaches, methods and data sources applied. First, our review highlights that the activity space approach enables segregation to be studied from the perspectives of people, places and mobility flows. Second, the results reveal that both traditional data sources and novel big data sources are valuable for studying activity space segregation. While traditional sources provide rich background information on people for examining the social dimension of segregation, big data sources bring opportunities to address temporality, and increase the spatial extent and resolution of analysis. Hence, big data sources have an important role in mediating the conceptual change from a residential neighborhood-based to an activity space-based approach to segregation. Still, scholars should address carefully the challenges and uncertainties that big data entail for segregation studies. Finally, we propose a framework for a three-step methodological workflow for activity space segregation analysis, and outline future research avenues to move toward more conceptual clarity, integrated analysis framework and methodological rigor.},

However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with reducing mobility patterns especially for socially vulnerable populations. The research examines two datasets at a granular scale for five urban locations. Through exploratory analysis of networks, statistics, and spatial clustering, the research extensively investigates the exposure risk reduction after the implementation of NPIs to socially vulnerable populations, specifically lower income and non-white populations. The mobility dataset tracks population movement across ZIP codes for an origin{\textendash}destination (O{\textendash}D) network analysis. The population activity dataset uses the visits from census block groups (cbg) to points-of-interest (POIs) for network analysis of population-facilities interactions. The mobility dataset originates from a collaboration with StreetLight Data, a company focusing on transportation analytics, whereas the population activity dataset originates from a collaboration with SafeGraph, a company focusing on POI data. Both datasets indicated that low-income and non-white populations faced higher exposure risk. These findings can assist emergency planners and public health officials in comprehending how different populations are able to implement protective actions and it can inform more equitable and data-driven NPI policies for future epidemics.},

Mobile phones represent a unique opportunity to monitor international mobility flows in a timely manner and with proper spatial aggregation. This work proposes using roaming data generated by mobile phones to model incoming and outgoing international mobility. We use the gravity and radiation models to capture mobility flows before and during the introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, traditional models have some limitations: for instance, mobility restrictions are not explicitly captured and may play a crucial role. To overtake such limitations, we propose the COVID Gravity Model (CGM), namely an extension of the traditional gravity model that is tailored for the pandemic scenario. This proposed approach overtakes, in terms of accuracy, the traditional models by 126.9\% for incoming mobility and by 63.9\% when modeling outgoing mobility flows.},

	abstract = {An origin-destination (OD) flow is the movement of objects from an origin to a destination. Determining how the flows vary across geographic locations helps understand the mechanism of flow distributions; however, it has rarely been studied. Here, we propose a trend surface model with polynomial functions to quantify the flow distribution with coordinates in the flow space. This model assumes that an observed data-record is composed of the trend value and the residual, and is represented by the orthogonal polynomial with O and D coordinates as independent variables and flow properties as dependent variables. The simulation experiments based on the linear and quadratic models indicated that the trend surface function could reflect the increasing/decreasing variation of flows with OD locations (i.e. flow trends) in different patterns. Applying this model to a case study of taxi OD flows in the broad Central Business District of Beijing, we found that the flows exhibited a rising trend toward the southwest. The trend surface characteristics are associated with the distributions of urban functional patches, where the workplaces and residences increased toward the southwest in the study area. Notably, the spatial deviations of trend surface model can help in identifying site pairs that attract flows at a high density (e.g. commerce centers and big communities), facilitating the planning of public transportation to mitigate the congestion.},

This study develops a data-driven framework to model day-to-day route choice dynamics, in which different interpretable travel decision-making mechanisms and efficient model training algorithms are incorporated. The route choice is estimated following a Dirichlet distribution. By introducing a high-order hidden Markov state model, the framework can detect the routine and sudden changes of the mechanism and apply them accordingly for prediction. We propose a particle-based Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate model parameters. As a pioneering work that links transportation data with different behaviour mechanisms, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework through a numerical example. With more transportation data, the proposed approach could become an attractive alternative to conventional transportation models.},

While mobility is driven by individual needs and preferences, the specific choice of venues to visit is usually constrained by the socioeconomic status of people. The complex interplay between people and places they visit, given their personal attributes and homophily leaning, is a key mechanism behind the emergence of socioeconomic stratification patterns ultimately leading to urban segregation at large. Here we investigate mixing patterns of mobility in the twenty largest cities of the United States by coupling individual check-in data from the social location platform Foursquare with census information from the American Community Survey. We find strong signs of stratification indicating that people mostly visit places in their own socioeconomic class, occasionally visiting locations from higher classes. The intensity of this {\textquoteleft}upwards bias{\textquoteright} increases with socioeconomic status and correlates with standard measures of racial residential segregation. Our results suggest an even stronger socioeconomic segregation in individual mobility than one would expect from system-level distributions, shedding further light on uneven mobility mixing patterns in cities.},

Mobility information comes in the form of daily activities sampled from a model based on Call Detail Records (CDR). Spatial information comprise parks represented through OpenStreetMaps polygons and census tracts from the 2010 decennial US Census. The framework summarizes each city{\textquoteright}s information into one bipartite weighted network with the link weights representing the number of potential visits to a park from each census tract on an average weekday. We compare park exposure and park demand in Greater Los Angeles and Greater Boston in a pre-pandemic scenario. The park exposure of a census tract is calculated as the number of parks surrounding the daily activities of its inhabitants. The demand of a park is calculated as the number of daily activities surrounding it. We find that both cities{\textquoteright} distribution of park exposure have similar shape with Boston having a higher average. On the other hand, the distribution of park demand is very similar in both cities, although their park spatial distributions are different. We include racial/ethnic information from the Census to explore how the park exposure connects tracts of different racial/ethnic groups. We associate parks to racial/ethnic groups based on the number of visitors from each group. Parks within minorities{\textquoteright} tracts are mostly used by majority groups. Finally, through detecting communities in the network, we find that park exposure connects the cities locally, linking parks to their tracts nearby. Furthermore, we find a significant spatial correlation between network communities and different racial/ethnic composition in Los Angeles. This way, patterns of park exposure reproduce the separation among demographic groups of the city.},

	abstract = {As the living tissue connecting urban places, streets play significant roles in driving city development, providing essential access, and promoting human interactions. Understanding street activities and how these activities vary across different streets is critical for designing both efficient and livable streets. However, current street classification frameworks primarily focus on either streets{\textquoteright} functions in transportation networks or their adjacent land uses rather than actual activity patterns, resulting in coarse classifications. This research proposes an activity-based street classification framework to categorize street segments based on their temporal street activity patterns, which is derived from high-resolution de-identified and privacy-enhanced mobility data. We then apply the proposed framework to 18,023 street segments in the City of Boston and reveal 10 distinct activity-based street types (ASTs). These ASTs highlight dynamic street activities on streets, which complements existing street classification frameworks, which focus on the static or transportation characteristics of the street segments. Our results show that a street classification framework based on temporal street activity patterns can identify street categories at a finer granularity than current methods, which can offer useful implications for state-of-the-art urban management and planning. In particular, we find that our classification distinguishes better those streets where crime is more prevalent than current functional or contextual classifications of streets.},

Up to this day, such analyses have been conducted using the upper bound of predictability of human mobility.

In this work, we confirm these discrepancies and, instead of predictability measure, we focus on explaining what impacts the actual accuracy of human mobility predictions. We show that the accuracy of predictions is dependent on the similarity of transitions observed in the training and test sets derived from the mobility data. We propose and evaluate five pattern matching based-measures, which allow us to quickly estimate the potential prediction accuracy of human mobility. As a result, we find that our metrics can explain up to 90\% of its variability. We also find that measures that were proved to explain the variability of predictability measure, fail to explain the variability of predictions accuracy. This suggests that predictability measure and accuracy of predictions should not be compared. Our metrics can be used to quickly assess how predictable the data will be for prediction algorithms. We share developed metrics as a part of HuMobi, the open-source Python library.},

	abstract = {Cities have been extensively studied as complex adaptive systems over the last 50 years. Recently, several empirical studies and emerging theory provided support for the fact that many different urban indicators follow general consistent statistical patterns across countries, cultures and times. In particular, total personal income, measures of innovation, crime rates, characteristics of the built environment and other indicators have been shown to exhibit non-linear power-law scaling with the population size of functional cities. Here, we show how to apply this type of analysis inside cities to establish universal patterns in the quantity and distribution of urban amenities such as restaurants, parks, and universities. Using a unique data set containing millions of amenities in the 50 largest US metropolitan areas, we establish general non-linear scaling patterns between each city{\textquoteright}s population and many different amenities types, the small-area statistics of their spatial abundance, and the characteristics of their mean distance to each other. We use these size-specific statistical findings to produce generative models for the expected amenity abundances of any US city. We then compute the deviations observed in given cities from this statistical many-amenity model to build a characteristic signature for each urban area. Finally, we show how urban planning can be guided by these systemic quantitative expectations in the context of new city design or the identification of local deficits in service provision in existing cities.},

By taking full advantages of each kind of public transit vehicles and optimizing their spatiotemporal cooperation with pedestrian evacuation, our models can greatly improve the global evacuation efficiency. Experiments on a realistic event was carried to validate the proposed model.

This study presents a Bayesian spatially varying coefficient (SVC) model to explore the spatially nonstationary relationship between mixed land use and urban vibrancy after controlling for other factors. We first use the convolutional conditional autoregressive prior to accommodate the ecological bias resulting from unobserved confounders. Then we develop our approach in the case of a single predictor to allow the spatially varying coefficient process. We further introduce a type of the Bayesian SVC model that considers the stratified heterogeneity of the outcome, allowing the coefficients to simultaneously vary at the local and subregion level. We illustrate the proposed model by conducting a case study in Shenzhen using mobile phone data, an officially registered point-of-interest (POI) dataset, and several supplementary datasets. The model evaluation results show that including spatially unstructured and structured component combinations can improve the model's fitness and predictive ability; additionally, considering spatial stratified heterogeneity can further enhance the model's performance. Our findings provide an alternative for measuring the variable local-scale association between mixed-use and urban vibrancy and offer new insights that broaden the fields of environmental science and spatial statistics.},

The spatial pattern of the nighttime economy{\textendash}housing imbalance was explored, and its association with the built environment was investigated through city-scale geographical regression analysis in Shanghai, China. The results showed that the sub-districts of Shanghai with high-positive-imbalance intensities displayed structures with superimposed rings and striped shapes, and the sub-districts with negative imbalance intensities were distributed around high positive-intensity areas. There were significant linear correlations between imbalance intensity and the built environment. The multiple influences of built environment factors and related mechanisms were explored from a geographical perspective. Our study utilized the social sensing data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the nighttime economy{\textendash}housing imbalance.

The built environment, including land use, buildings, and public facilities, has an important influence on bus travel demand prediction. However, previous studies regarded the built environment as a static feature thus even ignored its influence on bus travel in deep learning framework. To fill this gap, we propose a graph deep learning-based approach coupling with spatiotemporal influence of built environment (GDLBE) to enhance short-term bus travel demand prediction. A time-dependent geographically weighted regression method is used to resolve the dynamic influence of the built environment on bus travel demand at different times of the day. A graph deep learning module is used to capture the comprehensive spatial and temporal dependency behind massive bus travel demand. The short-term bus travel demand is predicted by fusing the dynamic built environment influences and spatiotemporal dependency. An experiment in Shenzhen is conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Baseline methods are compared, and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines. These results will help bus fleet dispatch for smart transportation.},

However, place-based potential accessibility methods do not accurately measure real gaps in the uptake of activity opportunities because people usually have limited activity spaces. This study introduces people-based activity space approaches to measure activity disparities between the two modal groups. To overcome difficulties in obtaining large-scale individual activity data, this study used vehicle plate recognition data and public transit smart card data to anonymously identify activities. Individual activity spaces were characterised by six primary activity features from different dimensions. The analysis confirmed that, relative to transit riders, people who use cars on average accessed more activities within a larger activity space and enjoyed overall higher travel efficiency. A comprehensive indicator was further derived from the primary activity features to quantify activity disparities at the zone level. Zones with the highest risk of social exclusion were observed in the outskirts. In contrast, the city centre and inner suburbs exhibited significant equality of the two transport modes in fulfilling mobility needs for engagement in activities. Activity disparities between the two modalities were determined per area in specific activity dimensions, namely activity extensity, activity diversity, and travel efficiency. Finally, statistical models provided evidence that public transport facilities (especially rail transit) and location factors (distance to the city centre) are essential in determining modality-associated gaps in access to urban activity opportunities. Socioeconomic status and land use diversity also partially contributed to the inequality in specific dimensions of the activity space. This people-centred approach is critical for tackling transport inequality and achieving SDGs while {\textquotedblleft}leaving no one behind{\textquotedblright}.},

Our analysis of data for over 3,100 U.S. counties reveals that annual population flows, resulting from domestic migration during the 2015{\textendash}2019 period, are much larger than natural demographic growth, and are primarily responsible for this heterogeneous growth. More precisely, we show that intra-city flows are generally along a negative population density gradient, while inter-city flows are concentrated in high-density core areas. Intra-city flows are anisotropic and generally directed towards external counties of cities, driving asymmetrical urban sprawl. Such domestic migration dynamics are also responsible for tempering local population shocks by redistributing inflows within a given city. This spill-over effect leads to a smoother population dynamics at the county level, in contrast to that observed at the city level. Understanding the spatial structure of domestic migration flows is a key ingredient for analyzing their drivers and consequences, thus representing a crucial knowledge for urban policy makers and planners.},

	abstract = {Dockless micromobility services have potential as a fast and flexible solution to short-distance trips and public transit's first-mile/last-mile (FM/LM) access problem; however, these services also have limitations, including uneven spatial distribution, low capacity, and user out of pocket expense. This can impact on the ability of micromobility to enhance public transit accessibility. We introduce accessibility increment measures {\textendash} the amount by which public transit accessibility improves due to micromobility services. We apply these measures to hypothetical trips using public transit and micromobility data from Columbus, Ohio, USA. We find dockless scooters can increase accessibility by multimodal public transit trips, with increments in the first mile significantly outweighing last mile accessibility increments. Accessibility increments are highly concentrated in the city center due to the distributions of scooters and bus stops. We also find that scooters' accessibility increment contribution is highly unequal: a small number of scooters contribute most of the accessibility increments. Monetary cost simulations show that the first-mile accessibility increment will rapidly decrease and last-mile increment slightly increase with lower willingness to pay. Capacity simulations show a group of users' accessibility increment will rapidly decrease as the group size increases, but this depends on whether they are competing or collaborating for scooters. Our results show that despite showing promising potentials, vendors and policymakers still need to address these issues to make collaboration between public transit and dockless micromobility sustainable and equitable. The paper provides measures and evidence for future transit and micromobility planning for scooter vendors and transit authorities.},

	abstract = {As cities continuously expand and with the emergence of mega-city regions, the urban functional zones (UFZs) have spread beyond their original administrative boundaries. An accurate and updated delineation of the UFZs is crucial for assessing the functional integration between cities within a mega-city region. Mobility data provides a chance to depict the UFZs from actual human activities at a finer spatial scale. Existing studies mostly adopted network-based approaches relying on the topological relationship but ignoring spatial factors, causing the lack of sensitivity in detecting the cross-cities integration of the functional region. This research proposed a novel regionalisation algorithm that redraws non-overlap boundaries of urban functional zones based on the commuting origin-destination matrix, representing the spatial interactions within cities and cross-cities. In particular, functional zones are drawn by searching for the best partition with the best goodness of fitting in the hierarchical spatial interaction model. The algorithm was applied to a case study of a mega-city region, Shenzhen-Dongguan-Huizhou (SDH) area in China using mobile phone signalling data. By adopting two different settings, this model evaluated the current status and predict the future trend of urban integration respectively. The results show the current boundary of UFZs in the SDH area almost coincides with administrative boundaries. Meanwhile, the results of long-term predictions might be utilised by policymakers to give more attention to the areas near the Dongguan-Huizhou boundary to promote industry cooperation and avoid mismatches between the functional and administrative regions.},

This study proposes a geographically weighted regression model based on metro network distance (ND-GWR) to capture the local patterns of relationships between the built environment (BE) and station-level metro ridership. The ND-GWR calculates network distances rather than traditional distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski) to calibrate the spatial weight matrix, which can more truly characterize the associations among stations in the real world. Five types of independent variables, including demographic, land use, network, transfer, and station characteristics, are calculated by an exponential distance-decay function. This study also compares the modeling results across holidays, weekdays, and weekends to analyze temporal variations of BE's effects. Using data collected in 2019 in Shenzhen, China, the modeling results show that (1) the integration of ND-GWR and the decay-distance function can estimate the relationships between BE variables and metro ridership with higher accuracy; (2) bike-metro access-integrated use has positive impacts on metro ridership, and it presents more significant in the city periphery and on weekdays; (3) senior citizens (aged over 60) are unwilling to use the metro service due to the defect of their physical functions. The negative effects exhibit smaller in the city center and on holidays; (4) whether the effects of BE variables vary over space is highly affected by when the event happened. The findings are expected to provide insights for calibrating spatial models and increasing the attractiveness of metro systems.},

	abstract = {Cities can be characterized and modelled through different urban measures. Consistency within these observables is crucial in order to advance towards a science of cities. Bettencourt
              et al
              . have proposed that many of these urban measures can be predicted through universal scaling laws. We develop a framework to consistently define cities, using commuting to work and population density thresholds, and construct thousands of realizations of systems of cities with different boundaries for England and Wales. These serve as a laboratory for the scaling analysis of a large set of urban indicators. The analysis shows that population size alone does not provide us enough information to describe or predict the state of a city as previously proposed, indicating that the expected scaling laws are not corroborated. We found that most urban indicators scale linearly with city size, regardless of the definition of the urban boundaries. However, when nonlinear correlations are present, the exponent fluctuates considerably.},
